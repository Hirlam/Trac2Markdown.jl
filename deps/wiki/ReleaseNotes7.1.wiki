== Release of Hirlam 7.1 ==

HIRLAM 7.1 is launched on March 28, 2007. It replaces [wiki:Hirlam_7.0 Hirlam 7.0] as the official Hirlam system. Meanwhile, the operational NWP forecast suite at Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), Regular Cycle of the Reference Hirlam (RCR), has been switched to the new version, starting from the cycle 06 UTC on that day, see [http://fminwp.fmi.fi/ the FMI monitoring page of RCR 7.1].

== Highlights of Hirlam 7.1 ==

Codewise hirlam 7.1 is identical to [wiki:ReleaseNotes7.1rc2 Hirlam 7.1 rc2 ], released on March 14, 2007. The system features several major updates with meteorological significance:
 * __Increased model resolution__. The reference model domain, RCR_7.1, has now a grid mesh of 538x440x60 at a resolution of 0.15 degree on rotated coordinate. Compared to the previous reference model domain RCR_7.0 with a grid mesh of 438x348x40 at 0.2 degree resolution, the new domain RCR_7.1 increases resolution in both horizontal and vertical. Note that these updates do not include changes for model boundaries in lateral or vertical. The resolution increase affects all levels but more weight has been put to lower troposphere. 
 * __3D-VAR with 6 h assimilation interval__. For upper air data assimilation, an extensively tested 4D-VAR data assimilation option with single outerloop has been introduced, although 3D-VAR is still default analysis option. For 3D-VAR, following changes have been introduced:
   * assimilation interval has been changed to 6 h
   * new reference background error structure function, derived from forecast runs on RCR_7.1 domain, has been introduced 
   * minimisation is made at full model resolution
   * conjugate gradient minimization method replaces quasi-Newton minimisation (M1QN3) as default scheme
   * the variational quality control on-off limits have been changed to be at 20 and 3o, respectively
 * __Moist CBR and tuned STRACO__. An upgrade of HIRLAM physical parameterisation has been done with IFS-compatible F90 codes. The physics package is now in phase with the one that is introduced into HIRLAM's mesoscale forecast system HARMONIE. The recoded physics parameterization includes CBR, STRACO and radiation processes
   * In STRACO, prognostic cloud water and cloud ice is introduced instead of prognostic cloud condensate
   * In CBR scheme, moist conserved variables are mixed implying radically different treatment of clouds due to turbulence parameterization. The scheme allows some flexibility with regard to mixing and coupling to convection schemes
   * In STRACO condensation scheme, convective cloud cover has been updated and tuned
   * The optional condensation package, Kain Fritsh Rasch Kristjansson scheme, has been updated
 * __Statistical balance structure function__ becomes reference. The data are derived from the RCR forecasts, using NMC method and for both 40 and 60 levels. The size of the scaling factor is around 0.5 by default
 * __No filtering of cloud water/ice__ in digital filter initialization. In addition, 3D total cloud cover is added to the model states for history i/o to allow recycling of cloud cover information
 * __Improved wind maxima at model top__. A bug correction is introduced to overcome unrealistic accumulation of wind maxima at the model top during winter season

From technical aspects, a significant amount of  technical changes and improvement has been introduced in Hirlam 7.1, such as,
 * __Extended post-processing stream__ with more diagnostic parameters such as CAPE, precipitation type, gust wind, visibility, screen-level wind and temperature maxima/minima etc. 
 * __Revised standard forecast output stream__ and additional templates for convenience of user-specified output stream
 * __Revised archiving strategy__ which by default put significantly less data into archive
 * __An enhanced ECMWF MARS data retrieval__  to enable use of BC-suite data, the option to retrieve data on rotated grid and with frame
 * __MSO/SSO parameters in climate generation__, thus opens up the possibility to parameterize mesoscale and subgrid scale orographic effects
 * __HPCE__ as the standard platform on ECMW
 * __Bug fixs in climate generation__ A number of important bug corrections in climate generation to avoid data hole problem and round-off effects are implemented
 * __Bug fixs, code/scripts cleaning__ A number of improvement and cleaning in code and scripts have been implemented

In addition, Hirlam 7.1 also features numerous non-default system components for analysis and forecast system. Among those,
 * __4D-VAR analysis__ for upper air data assimilation, formulated with incremental approach. In the current baseline system, the 4D-VAR configuration consists of following main characteristics:
   * single outerloop with innerloop resolution at 0.45 degree, (3 times coarser resolution than the forecast model); linear grid
   * assimilation cycle is 6 h
   * observation data cut off time at 2h30m, thus the assimilation window is 3.5 h before nominal analysis time and 2.5 h after
   * 30 minute time step used for integration with tangent linear and adjoint models during minimisation
   * observation time slot is 1 h, centered at even hour
   * no special tuning of background and observation error statistics have been applied in comparison to 3D-VAR
   * simplified vertical diffusion scheme, imported from Meteo-France Arpege global 4D-VAR, is included in the tangent linear and adjoint models
   * re-forecast scheme, in which ECMWF analysis is coupled to HIRLAM first guess via incremental digital filter initialization, is applied to provide background field for 4D-VAR analysis
   * surface analysis (SPAN) is performed after the nonlinear trajectory forecast and only for synoptic hour
   * weak constraint for gravity wave damping during 4D-VAR inner loop, using digital filtering. No explicit initialization during or after 4D-VAR
   * variational quality control is applied between iteration number of 15 and 25
   * no explicit initialization scheme applied for 4DVAR option, thanks to the DFI weak constraint applied during 4D-VAR minimization which ensures quasi-balance of analysed model states
   * conjugate gradient minimization package is used with iteration limit set to 60. An alternative minimization method with M1QN3 method is available
   * tangent linear model used to project 4D-VAR analysis increment, which is valid at the start of assimilation window, to the nominal analysis time to obtain the nominal analysis valid at the analysis time. Forecast is started from analysis time as in 3D-VAR
 * __Optional SL-SETTLS advection scheme__ is introduced to the grid-point model, using the DMI implementation
 * __HIRLAM ensemble forecast generation scripts__ in its first version
 * __Optional surface relative humidity assimilation__ module
 * __AMV__ assimilation module to assimilate Atmospheric Motion Vector data from polar satellite (MODIS) and geostationary satellites (Meteosat 8). The option is still non-default at the moment
 * __Optional analysis strategy NOUA__ to allow dynamic adaptation cycling using combination of external upper air analysis and nested surface analysis

== Meteorological Evaluation ==

Hirlam 7.1 has been tested extensively during its development stages and noticeable positive impact on forecast results have been found in several parameters, such as improvement on surface pressure bias, scores for geopotential height, reduced over-prediction of precipitation in winter season and improved precipitation in summer seasons for high precipitation events.
