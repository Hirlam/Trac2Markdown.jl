
== System developments in HARMONIE ==


'''What is the purpose of the repository:'''


Easy access to an updated version of a NWP-system. This doesn't mean
that it is easy to use, yet.


'''Content of respository:'''


trunk/harmonie

- src ALADIN source code cy31t1

- scr Scripts to run HARMONIE cy31t1

- nam namelists for ALADIN -cy32t2

- util/
    - ddh : DDH utilities
    - gl  : file manipulation
    - hirmars : MARS filter
    - monitor : Verificaion and monitoring
    - gmkpack : Compiling and version control


Vendor branches

- aladin
    - cy31t1
    - cy32t1

- gmkpack version 6.2 - 6.2.2



'''What is done since ASM in Oslo'''

    - namelists up to cy32t2 added
    - Postprocessing added, includes "fullmix" which enables us to posprocess arome forecasts with fullpos
    - Climate generation of SURFEX files added
    - Pseudosatellite variables
    - Contingency tables added in verification
    - Add DDH tools
    - Other technical changes
    - Improved wiki


'''Things in the plan/pipeline ( system + dynamics+validation )'''

    - Rotated mercator in interpolation (INM)
    - Replace FA with GRIB (UA not started)
    - Update repository to CY32t2, gmkpack 6.2.3 (SOMEONE) 
    - Coupling :-(UA)
          - Surfex needs a new coupling 
          - gl/fullpos
          - NH-fields
    - Radarsimulator

'''On the interaction with ALADIN/MF'''
    - The MF installation of cycles at HPCE are pure technical implementations. It compiles but that's all.
    - The new export versions does always contain namelists. Personal interaction always needed.
    - How do we "sell" the repository to the rest of ALADIN?
    

'''Things to be done/decided'''
    - Assimilation environment added or not. If it is there it can be used!
    - The procedure and responsibility of updating the repository, specially for MF input
    - Climate and Surfex climate file generation in system
    - Until assimilation for mesoscale available -> cycling of surface variables.
