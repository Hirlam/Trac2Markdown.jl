'''Meteorological experience from high-resolution runs'''

 - Meteorological performance nearly as good as in other models.
 - Precipitation structures look realistic.
 - However, convective precipitation seem to be overestimated. Consequently, downdrafts are too intense (divergence at low levels).

 - Recent reports

'''Technical experiences/problems'''

 - Real-time suites has been running more or less stable. 
    - Summer 2006: night-time temperature was too cold due to a bug in HIRLAM's soil ice --> Corrected to HIRLAM 7.1
    - Soil ice (from HIRLAM) close to zero, caused a crash in AROME --> Corrected in cy32t2.
    - 60 s time step is sometimes too large during wintertime (FMI). --> Noisy fields (e.g. MSLP, winds). Still the model has not crashed. 
 
 - Since gmkpack.6.2.2, compilation has been much easier than before. Still, building of the full code is '''extremely slow'''.

 - The problems related to new test suites (cy32t1 and cy32t2)
    - Typical platform dependent problems (e.g. compiler related problems, annoying FPE-signals etc.).
    - SURFEX is coded very badly, the first timesteps take a lot of time. MF has found that reading of surface fields is done 19 times per processor.
    - Non-initialized variables may cause a crash in some platforms (e.g. in AROME's turbulence scheme in 32t2).

 - Too many and constantly changing namelists, too many switches.  Hard to keep track what are the ''default'' values.
