= '''GLAMEPS product web page contents''' =

The GLAMEPS product web page is located at
[https://glameps.org/]. There are
two major branches with plot products:

1. '''forecasted'''

1. '''valid'''

Each of these branches contains menue items on the left hand side for different parameters
(`AccPcp3h`, `G10m` etc.), different thresholds, etc.

The menues on the top side indicate the date and time information, and
'Forecast Length' or 'Age Rank'.


== '''What toCheck''' ==

check that the latest data have been transferred on to the web page:

  1. navigate into either 'forecasted' or 'valid'

  1. check the date and time in the top menue is prefilled with todays datum
     [[Color(red, NOTE)]]: todays datum should appear after 10:40 UTC has passed. If you check the page earlier, then yesterdays datum is still shown, and todays plots have most probably not arrived yet.
