== Announcement by Xiaohua Yang == 

Following the advices from colleagues working on regional climate modelling at HIRLAM services and the recommendations from the recent HIRLAM Advisory Committee meeting,  HIRLAM-B Management Group  (MG) wishes to propose a discussion meeting,  during early 2015,  on the subject of developing collaboration on regional climate modelling with HARMONIE forecast model as basis.

Over the past 10 year or so the LAM-NWP communities in HIRLAM services have worked intensively to build a mesoscale HARMONIE forecast system suitable for short range weather forecasting at the kilometer scale. HARMONIE system is a collaboration between HIRLAM and Meteo France/ALADIN consortia, with direct/indirect links to ECMWF/IFS.  Development of the HARMONIE NWP has benefited also from the active contributions by colleagues working on regional climate modelling at the HIRLAM services. Especially, a HARMONIE Climate branch was initiated already some years ago at Rossby center, SMHI,  which has already resulted in a well shaped system infrastructure and scientific publications, see  e.g. the information on HIRLAM wiki
https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieClimate

In our view, time is ripe now for interested parties from RCM communities to come together and discuss on a future collaboration with km-scale regional climate modelling based on HARMONIE forecast model. HIRLAM-B programme wishes to contribute to the process especially at the start phase,  with a view to seek long term, mutual benefits from synergic efforts by both NWP and RCM communities, on multiple aspects.  

In view of the pioneering role of Rossby center, SMHI on development of the HARMONIE-based RCM, HIRLAM-B MG proposes to hold the first HARMONIE-RCM discussion meeting in Norrköping, SMHI. The discussion meeting is of course also open to the RCM colleagues working at the ALADIN/LACE consortia.

      [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieClimate/HCLIMmeetingMarch2015/Discussion_HARMONIE_Climate_SHMI2014.ppt Discussion presentation]

   i. Development: 
    - Physics Options (Alaro, Arome etc) ideally we will work with one physics package, and preferably similar to the NWP version
    -  model development: what are the priorities, who works on what
    -  which cycle version could we use as a common starting point (considering updates in radiation and ice microphysics)

      The HARMONIE system offers in general one dynamical core option and two atmospheric physics packages, AROME at 1-3 km scales and ALARO at 2-12 km scales. There is one surface physics option represented by SURFEX. Do the individual groups contribute to development to one or more of these options? If so, can we then find collaboration, and focus resources, around specific validation and development needs? E.g. precipitation processes in ALARO, dynamics and boundary conditions, 2-way nesting, sea ice in SURFEX, glacier performance in SURFEX, reasons for biases in T2m, etc? 

   i. Use
    - climate purposes : do we have the same ideas for usage
    - flexibility(  position of domain etc)
    - How often do we phase to a new version ( probably at a slower pace than NWP)

      What purpose do we have with HCLIM applications in our groups. E.g. traditional RCM downscaling of GCM output for future scenarios and/or running HARMONIE NWP style system in climate mode. This question also relates to how NWP and climate applications can benefit from each other. For example, at SMHI we have the ambition to be ahead with climate application of a new cycle to validate/develop the cycle from a climate (multi-year) perspective before NWP and data assimilation additions. [wiki:HarmonieClimate/HCLIM_NWP_cycles This idea is presented here along with some comments. Please take a look before the meeting].

   i. Validation:
    - How / What
    - additions to NWP validation
    - how to profit from one another's tools (is anyone able to present some experience?)

     If options used by different groups are similar, we can benefit from sharing/discussing results of validation (biases and reasons for them). Is there any interest/need to cooperate around validation tools in addition to those already used for NWP? E.g., at SMHI we now look into how [https://code.zmaw.de/projects/pycmbs and https://github.com/pygeo/pycmbs pyCMBS] can be used. This tool provides both an interactive validation environment and automatic benchmarking, as well as the whole chain from observational and model data files to a structured validation report in the end. Ralf Döscher offers a short presentation on [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieClimate/HCLIMmeetingMarch2015/ClimateModelValidation_a4.pdf "Quantifying climate model validation"] that can highlight some validation aspects.

 === Tuesday, March 3, 09:00-13:00 ===

 * ''' 09:00 Development environment, repository, technical issues''' (Discussion leader: Patrick Samuelsson, rapporteur: Petter Lind, [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieClimate/HCLIMmeetingMarch2015/Notes_day2.pdf Notes here.])

   i. Climate application repositories. HARMONIE development takes place under the HARMONIE repository (https://svn.hirlam.org/).
      * The SMHI version of HCLIM is located under a branch ([https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieClimate see here for details]). Are other groups interested in joining this development of HCLIM? If so, an inter-group development strategy is needed.
      * For climate NWP purposes (e.g. validating a NWP setup for a multi-year simulation) the HCLIM technical environment is still applicable (i.e. 6-hourly updates of SST and SIC, restart files for new month, output) as well as the atmospheric physics (e.g. AROME). However, SFX7.2 needs to be reinserted and the system needs minor development connected to that:
        * Since no prognostic sea-ice temperature is available in any official SFX version prior to v8 the 6-hourly update of SST and SIC needs to be complemented with ice-surface temperature for model domains where sea ice needs to be considered.
        * Lake-surface temperature needs more frequent updates (now it is only initialized with a deep soil temperature and kept constant during a simulation).
      The best way forward is probably to complement HARMONIE trunk with the HCLIM technical development + the two additional items to create a NWP environment where multi-year simulations are possible, alternatively? Some work is needed!

   i. The development of the SMHI version of HCLIM has required a number of technical changes in the scripting part of HARMONIE. Needs to further such development could be: full precision restart (already there?), have the ability to run transient simulations without a monthly restart, direct output of NetCDF (underway),  

   i. From a climate modelling perspective HARMONIE as a system is very complicated (compilation, namelist, boundary conditions, scripts, running, output). It requires a lot of support to apply and much development time is spent on system related issues (compared to climate process development). As HARMONIE looks HCLIM can not be used by any group where HARMONIE system know-how is missing! This limits cooperation beyond HIRLAM groups. Can we develop a more user-friendly system (compare openIFS)? Is there a common interest for this? [wiki:HarmonieClimate/User_friendly_HARMONIE Take a look here for more background and discussion].
