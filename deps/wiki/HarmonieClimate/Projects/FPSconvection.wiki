'''This page is intended for communication of the status of FPS Convection simulations.'''


== Background and project description ==

FPS Convection is a collaborative CORDEX project. Here are described the common contributions by three institutes: DMI, MET Norway, and SMHI. Scenarios are for RCP8.5.


== Simulation protocol ==

The list of output variables is located in [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u6pYHGNYsli3r-lmeMdK3fCg4M1FCK6C6_Lbh0mMjg0/edit?usp=sharing this google document.]

Run time estimates
* DMI @ ECMWF: 1 model month averages 10.1 hours (real time). Estimated time full run: 50.5 days. Estimated end: (early) March

== Set up of simulations ==
Use the current HCLIM38h1 branch for this project. There are a number of files that need to be changed:
* [attachment:harmonie_namelists.pm harmonie_namelists.pm] for using hydrometeors and TKE from ALADIN as LBCs, goes to /nam.
* [attachment:E927 E927] for using hydrometeors and TKE from ALADIN as LBCs, goes to /scr (make sure it is executable).
* [attachment:Harmonie_domains.pm Harmonie_domains.pm] with the two FPS domains, goes to /scr (make sure it is executable).
* [attachment:Select_postp.pl Select_postp.pl] defining the output in FP files, goes to /scr (make sure it is executable).
* [attachment:config_exp.h config_exp.h] set-up for AROME, goes to /sms.
* [attachment:config_exp_ALADIN.h config_exp_ALADIN.h] set-up for ALADIN, goes to /sms, and rename.
Set the INSTITUTE variable in config_exp.h to your institute as this information is used as metadata in the netcdf files. You also need to change the paths specific to your HPC.[[BR]]
BDLIB is the path to forcing data. It is set to a common shared space on SCRATCH for everyone to use; /lus/snx11062/HCLIM_NORCP_LBC/<boundary forcing experiment>. Change [[BR]]
''boundary forcing experiment'' to the experiment folder that will provide boundary conditions. [[BR]]
When running with ALADIN we also need to change the selected output for surfex and there is a specific namelist for that (nam/surfex_selected_output_ALADIN.pm).[[BR]]
EC-Earth boundary forcing data for ALADIN simulations are stored on SCRATCH: /lus/snx11062/HCLIM_NORCP_LBC/<ec-earth exp> where ''ec-earth exp'' is either [[BR]]
'''EC_Earth_SHC1_HIST''' for historical data or '''EC_Earth_SS81_RCP85''' for scenarios.[[BR]]
