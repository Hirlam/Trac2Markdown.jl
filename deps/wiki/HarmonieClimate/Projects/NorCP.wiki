'''This page is intended for communication of the status of NorCP simulations.'''


== Background and project description ==

NorCP is a collaborative project by four institutes: DMI, FMI, MET Norway, and SMHI.


== Simulation protocol ==

The simulation protocol is attached [attachment:NorCP_simulations_protocol.pdf here].
The list of output variables is located in [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fIG-njRxTGicBmXr2pItr_7ud0pvK0YdJjUUlq4kz8A/edit?usp=sharing this google document][[BR]]
The AROME (3km) and ALADIN (12km) domains can be seen [attachment:NorCP_domains.png here].

Run time estimates
* DMI @ ECMWF: 1 model month averages 12.1 hours (real time). Estimated time full run: 120.9 days. Estimated end: (early) May 

SBUs estimates (based on EC-EARTH simulation, see $SCRATCH/experiment/SBU.log on ecgate)
* METno @ ECMWF: 1 model month ca. 175'300 SBUs. 1 model year ca. 2'000'000 SBUs. 1 time-slice (21 models year) ca. 44'000'000 SBUs

== Status of ALADIN simulations (intermediate resolution runs) ==

== Set up simulation on ECMWF ==
We have created a new branch for this project, so if there are any changes we see are needed we can commit to this branch
which will make it easier for everyone to be sure that we are using the same code.[[BR]]

**Check out code**
* svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/branches/climate/projects/NORCP/HCLIM38h1

**Set up experiment**
* <PATH TO SVN SOURCE>/config-sh/Harmonie setup -r <PATH TO SVN SOURCE> -h ecgb-cca

''config_exp.h''
As this is the main configuration file we are using, we have prepared it so it's as few settings as possible we need to change for our simulations.
The default file is used for our non-hydrostatic HCLIM-AROME simulations.[[BR]]
''config_exp.h.NORCP.AROME'' Template for AROME simulations, same as the default one. [[BR]]
''config_exp.h.NORCP.ALADIN'' Template for ALADIN simulations forced by ERA-Interim. [[BR]]
'''N.B.''' Don't forget to set your preferences for archiving data. Default is archiving everything at ecfs. Everything means your history, log files etc. for AROME runs and
also surfex (FA) files for the ALADIN simulations. This is dependent on SAVE_FAOUTPUT which we have preset. Also set the INSTITUTE variable to your institute as this information is used as metadata in the netcdf files.[[BR]]
BDLIB is the path to forcing data. It is set to a common shared space on SCRATCH for everyone to use; /lus/snx11062/HCLIM_NORCP_LBC/<boundary forcing experiment>. Change [[BR]]
''boundary forcing experiment'' to the experiment folder that will provide boundary conditions. [[BR]]
When running with ALADIN we also need to change the selected output for surfex and there is a specific namelist for that (nam/surfex_selected_output_ALADIN.pm).
