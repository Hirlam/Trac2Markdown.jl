== Summary by Erik Kjellström, head of Rossby Centre, SMHI == 

On March 2-3 2015 a meeting on HARMONIE-Climate was held at SMHI with participation from national meteorological institutes, or other research institutes in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. Also representatives from institutes in France, Hungary and Slovenia participated remotely via the web during parts of the meeting. 

Large efforts have been put into the development of the HARMONIE weather forecast system over the last decade. In recent years, a number of groups have started to explore possibilities to build on and use that system also for regional climate modelling purposes. The main objectives of the meeting were to:

  1. Get an update of the status of climate-related work with the HARMONIE forecast model.
  1. Identify potential areas of future collaboration with km-scale regional climate modelling based on the HARMONIE forecast model related to model development (dynamics / physics / ESM components), verification and validation, technical details repository / development environment), usage and flexibility (version updates / choice of domain).
  1. Propose a way forward.

The presentations from the groups show that activities in different countries are highly diverse with different groups using different model versions, physics packages for different domains etc. Also, foreseen future needs are different in terms of what resolution that is required (and thereby what physics packages should be used), if different earth system components should be integrated into the model system, what regions the model should be useful for (northern/southern Europe, the Arctic, tropical regions) etc.

Despite differences in applications and needs it is clear that there are potential benefits of collaborating around a HARMONIE-Climate model system. Among those are mutual benefits for the respective NWP and climate modelling communities to make use of achievements made in model development by the other community, joint work on technical issues and potentials to share tasks between institutes. 
From the meeting it can be summarized that:

  * There is a strong consensus among most meeting participants to go forward with collaboration around a HARMONIE-Climate model system.
  * In a short-term perspective the Rossby Centre will make available a technically working model version based on cycle 38h1.1 at the computer facilities at ECMWF. Other groups can test, develop and use this version. (This version was released in the beginning of June. [wiki:HarmonieClimate Please look here for details.])
  * In a HIRLAM-context a suggestion from the meeting is to make HARMONIE-Climate into an optional project. It would also be good to have a representative for HARMONIE-Climate in the HIRLAM management group. Finally, a proposal is that future general assemblies could contain a session on HARMONIE-Climate.
  * An issue was raised concerning the availability of the code also to other countries/institutes outside of the HARMONIE consortium. Explicitly, can HARMONIE-Climate be used for climate applications by research groups outside of Europe?
  * Not discussed at the meeting but raised by some people immediately after is the need for communicating with other HARMONIE developers before publishing results based on model code developed elsewhere.

== Comments by Xiaohua Yang, member of HIRLAM Management Group == 

Heiner Körnich, SMHI, made a comprehensive review at the meeting summarising status reported by different groups, discussions about  dynamics and physics options, validation methods, system and development environments and the topic about if and where to place HARMONIE-climate into the HIRLAM collaboration framework.

On the issue of whether or not to have RCM sticking together with NWP, the general response is that at the present it is virtually a requirement, not an option, as the RCM groups need badly assistance from NWP groups for startup. Compared to NWP, RCM research involve wider needs for collaboration, user friendliness and free usage. Such differences have been reflected in different priorities at the two communities. There is a common wish for HIRLAM consortia to increase user friendliness of the HARMONIE system. For the future, it is a general feeling that a structural guarantee for the two community to benefit more directly each other is to make the RCM related work as part of the HIRLAM collaboration, one way or another. 

It is suggested for the community to make use some of the HIRLAM communication platforms such as common repository, mailing list, wiki pages and discussion forum to facilitate and enhance communication within the emerging HARMONIE-RCM  community.

It was mentioned some funding opportunity related to development of European RCM in the framework of Horizon 2020, and in the plan for Copernicus climate change services, a deadline for proposal on funding for producing  climate prediction on April 21 was mentioned.

Above, Erik in his final remark summarised the outcome of the meeting. There is a clear will to do something in common on RCM with HARMONIE as model, and he cited some of the concrete results from this meeting: the commitment from SMHI to work out  an updated climate branch version, based on 38h1.1, suitable for test/evaluation in about one month time; A mailing  list climate@hirlam.org is to be setup to make the community visible, the agreement for all to talk to the home institutes suggesting for some focus/priorities toward RCM in the HARMONIE context, eventually in form of new collaboration area in the coming HIRLAM-C.

Finally, HIRLAM-B invited a representative from the participants to gave an overview talk, on behalf of this community,  at the coming HIRLAM-ALADIN All Staff Workshop to publicise the new initiative (see below). HIRLAM-B acknowledged SMHI for organisation of the meeting.

== A wiki version of the HCLIM presentation given by Patrick Samuelsson, SMHI, at the HIRLAM-ALADIN All Staff Workshop in April == 

Main discussion points brought up at the March meeting:

Can we join around a common development version of HCLIM?
Yes partly, some groups show interest in joining current SMHI HCLIM development version. But staying more close to NWP is focus for some. The technical development of HARMONIE for climate simulations is common! SMHI will make our HCLIM branch available for every one interested soon! (runs at ECMWF) 

Can we join around common physics?
No hardly, groups have different focus with their climate applications. E.g. hindcast case studies, multi-year future scenario simulations, high-resolution 1-2 km, more classical RCM scales 5-30 km, different processes ... Thus, different versions of AROME, ALARO and SURFEX are needed to fulfill all needs. Concern was brought up that some groups leave their CORDEX-style RCMs behind and need some replacement (ARPEGE and IFS physics options in HARMONIE!?)

How can HARMONIE NWP and climate benefit from each other?
Increased number of users means that more people invest development time on both system and processes. It is proposed that we should validate/develop/tune a new cycle of HARMONIE in climate mode before NWP/data assimilation applications follow. Climate ahead of NWP w.r.t. cycles. We should go for e.g. cy42 in next HCLIM (SURFEXv8).

More user friendly HARMONIE, especially for climate!?
Current HARMONIE system is experienced as very complex by some users with background in RCM modelling. The complexity requires system know-how in the corridor (can't be used outside NWP centers) and it slows down development speed. Voices were raised that a more simple version of HARMONIE should be developed. Compare Open-IFS.

HARMONIE-Climate, a new role in HIRLAM management group!?
Strong support at the Workshop that a climate applications of HARMONIE should become an official responsibility of HIRLAM-C. I.e. a HARMONIE-climate role in the HIRLAM management group.  Or as special project...
Please let your national HAC and council representatives know if you support this idea!


HARMONIE-Climate training!?
A HIRLAM training for HARMONIE Climate use is announced for September 14-17 2015.  [wiki:HarmonieSystemTraining2015 See here for more information!]

Can we join around validation tools or validation criteria!?
For validation of climate simulations we need to complement existing NWP validation tools. Such exists so no problem but we will probably not join around this among groups. However, we may define common criteria for what aspects should be fulfilled.


In the climate community it is essential to freely be able to distribute results to any user over any domain. Will that be possible with HARMONIE (ALARO/AROME)?

How do we communicate HCLIM experience/results/plans among groups?
A session at yearly ALADIN/HIRLAM Joint Workshop All Staff.
Dedicated HCLIM Workshops.
A HIRLAM climate email list does now exist: climate@hirlam.org
