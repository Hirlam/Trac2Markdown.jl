== Status of climate aspects in harmonie-40h1 ==

This list currently refers to the status of harmonie-40h1.1.beta.3 as was used for the [wiki:HarmonieSystemTraining2015/Exercises exercises during the HCLIM training in September 2015]. 

=== Implemented/misc ===

 * SST/SIC update from boundary (ECMWF) fields is working. No handling in the case of nesting from ALARO/AROME which is the case also in 38h1.1
 * SURFEX_LSELECT and restart functionality implemented. It also works with the I/O-server which is not the case for 38h1.1
 * Multi output streams working although not tailored for climate aspects.
 * ALARO0/ALARO1 namelist settings are tailored for HarmonEPS resolution (2.5km)
 * NetCDF conversion implemented.
 * 40h1 is based on SURFEX 7.3 with its known deficiencies in e.g. the DIF scheme.
 * SURFEX_PREP already default in 40h1.

=== Missing ===

 * Flake not tested.
 * Functionality to read RCP greenhouse gas data
 * All above mentioned SURFEX changes but LSELECT.
 * ECODIR/RCPDIR directory convention
 * ALARO to ALARO nesting unknown
 * SST_ONLY flag in gl_grib_api
 * Make some surface fields optional in gl interpolation ( technical change ) (Patrick Samuelsson)

=== Planned development ===

 * Ice model (Yurii Batrak)
 * RACMO turbulence formulation (Wim De Roy)
 * Microphysics updates (Karl-Ivar Ivarsson, Lisa Bengtsson)
 * Upgrade to ECOCLIMAP v2.3 (Ulf Andrae)
 * ALARO1 surfex interface (Patrick Samuelsson, Anna Fitch )
 * Better handling of minute output (name convention, FA file header) (Lars Berggren)
