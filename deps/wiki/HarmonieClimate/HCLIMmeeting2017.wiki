= '''Development and management of HARMONIE-Climate meeting, 6 - 7 November 2017 at SMHI in Norrköping''' =
[[LastModified]]
[[Center(end)]]


== Announcement == 

The purpose of the meeting is to activate collaboration and development of HARMONIE-Climate system. This is a follow-up of the 2015 meeting.

All comments and suggestions are welcome! Please send them to harmonie-climate(at)hirlam.org or danijel.belusic(at)smhi.se.

== Starting points == 

Some points from the 2015 meeting:
  * There is a strong consensus among most meeting participants to go forward with collaboration around a HARMONIE-Climate model system.
  * HARMONIE-Climate, a new role in HIRLAM management group!? Strong support at the Workshop that a climate applications of HARMONIE should become an official responsibility of HIRLAM-C. I.e. a HARMONIE-climate role in the HIRLAM management group. Or as special project...
  * How do we communicate HCLIM experience/results/plans among groups?
     * A session at yearly ALADIN/HIRLAM Joint Workshop All Staff.
     * Dedicated HCLIM Workshops.
     * A HIRLAM climate email list does now exist: climate(at)hirlam.org
     * NOTE: A new mailing list harmonie-climate(at)hirlam.org was created so that we have a more focused HARMONIE-Climate developers list

However, despite the constructive initial meeting and consequent plans, the collaboration never took off. Can we (re)start the collaboration efforts? What concrete actions are needed to get there?


== Action points == 

1. The main goal - create a management structure that will foster HARMONIE-Climate collaboration (i.e., how do we get to point 2 below):
  * Shall we follow the established HIRLAM management structure? 
  * We could have a two-person team:
    * A representative in the HIRLAM management group, responsible for communication within HARMONIE-Climate and with NWP groups
    * A system person responsible for the code
    * There is a question of funding for these two positions. So far individual institutes have dedicated a (percentage of a) person for the system position.

2. Decide where we want to go together (and what we leave for each institute to do on their own):
  * Level of collaboration: 
     * Common model version? Configuration?
     * Participate together in certain projects (e.g. CORDEX-FPS)
  * Level of proximity to NWP, code- and scripting-wise

A suggestion is to focus on organisational issues in this meeting, and leave detailed science and system discussions for a more dedicated meeting.
