== Description of Harmonie 38h1 ==

Harmonie 38h1 is HIRLAM's adaptation to the IFS/ARPEGE CY38T1 released in August 2012 and the subsequent bugfix versions 1 to 3. 

At its default, Harmonie-38h1 comprises the following features:

 * A meso-scale NWP forecast system with convection-permitting AROME physics and non-hydrostatic dynamics on a model grid with 2.5 km grid-spacing in horizontal and 65 vertical levels.
 * Treatment of surface processes by SURFEX
 * 3D-VAR upper air assimilation with 3h cycling using conventional observations and AMSUA AMSUB/MHS satellite information.
 * Optimal interpolation-based surface analysis using CANARI for the spatialization and SODA for the update of surface variables.
 * A comprehensive set of utilities for observation preprocessing, model diagnostics, monitoring and verification.
 * A scheduler, mSMS, and a graphical interface, mXCdp, for running an controlling the full suite.

== Meteorological performance of Harmonie-38h1.1 ==

Harmonie-38h1 is the first HARMONIE release which is accompanied by operational suits running in form of Regular Cycle of Reference HARMONIE (HARMONIE-RCR) at operational centers, i.e., Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI, on DKA domain, pre-operational since late Nov 2013, scheduled launch in late March 2014) and !MetCoOp (joint operational suite at MET and SMHI, on METCOOP25B domain, scheduled launch in March 2014). In addition, Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) operationalised 38h1-based operational suite on SCANDINAVIA25 domain in Jan 2014. 

Prior to the tagging of 38h1.1, large number of sensitivity experiments and validation tests have been performed throughout the HIRLAM member services, using development trunks or earlier tagged alpha, beta and rc versions. Aspects of validation tests includes those on various domains covering Spain & Canari Islands, Netherland, Denmark, Lithuania, Scandinavia, Iceland, with a large variety of data assimilation schemes (4DVAR, 3DVAR, 3DVAR-RUC, blending), use of observation data (AMSU-A, AMSU-B/mhs, AMV, MODES, Radar, GNSS, ASCAT), physical parameterisation (AROME, ALARO), and EPS configurations. 

An incomplete listing about configurations and evaluation about meteorological performances using various versions of 38h1 can be seen on the wiki page about [wiki:Harmonie_38h1/ValidationTests]. In general, in comparison to the previous official release 37h1.2, the meteorological performance of the new versions has been satisfactory. At its default, 38h1 has been shown to, generally,  
 * improved surface wind forecast for high wind conditions. 
 * improved forecast for mountain area especially on surface wind. 
 * improved surface humidity forecast. 
 * improved forecast for summer time surface temperature. 
Meanwhile, no significant changes have been seen on performance about forecast of precipitation, cloud and fog. For winter period, 38h1 runs have been seen to suffer a slightly increased negative bias in surface temperature for larger part of northern Europe.  

From validation studies it has been seen that observed changes in meteorolgical performances often are strongly related to the update in physiogeographic data base (ECCOCLIMAP2), tunning in SURFEX parameterisation (canopy drag and subgrid scale orographic parameterisation). It is noted that similar changes do not alwways results in positive impact. e.g., when applied to other domains.

== Meteorological performance of Harmonie-38h1.2 ==

Harmonie-38h1.2 is still under evaluation. The progress can bee seen [wiki:Harmonie_38h1/38h1.2_validation here].
