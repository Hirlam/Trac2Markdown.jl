== '''Replacement of FCINT, LL, LLMAIN and LLMAIN_FREQ''' ==
A more flexible way of specifying which cycles (UTC) to run, and the corresponding forecast length at these cycles has been implemented.
In the past, the following variables has been in use:
 * FCINT : forecast interval (in hours).
 * LL : forecast length (hours), same for all cycles if given without LLMAIN (see below).
 * LLMAIN : forecast length at '''main''' hours. What main means could be given by LLMAIN_FREQ (see below).
 * LLMAIN_FREQ : Interval (in hours, not really frequency) between main hours (e.g., 6 or 12).
If LLMAIN and LLMAIN_FREQ was given, forecast length at intermediate (not main) cycles would be LL=FCINT.

Although serving the purpose for most users, this scheme was still not really flexible.

== '''New variables: HH_LIST and LL_LIST''' ==
In Harmonie-40h1, two new variables replace the above four, but they are supposed to be '''lists'''.
 * HH_LIST : list of cycles (UTC hours) to run, comma separated, ranges and step allowed (see below).
 * LL_LIST  : list of forecast lengths corresponding to HH_LIST, with ''compatible'' list length to the HH_LIST list length.
For example:
{{{
HH_LIST="0-21:3"
LL_LIST="48,3"
}}}
Here HH_LIST has implicit length 8, "0-21:3" is a shorthand for "from 0 to 21 with steps of 3".
LL_LIST has length 2, which is OK since 8 is divisible by 2. It is equivalent to LL_LIST="48,3,48,3,48,3,48,3",
and means that the cycles 0, 6, 12 and 18 are run with 48h forecast length, and 3, 9, 15 and 21 with 3h forecast length.

== '''Note also:''' ==
 * At present the HH_LIST list must result in a constant "FCINT" throughout the day, otherwise !CheckOptions will complain.
 * HH_LIST and LL_LIST may (of course) be different for different members of an ensemble. As usual such differences must be given in harmonie.pm.
 * If members run different HH_LIST, they may in practice have different DTGBEG (first cycle). A "cold start" may therefore span several cycles, if members start differently.
 * The old variables LL and FCINT are still present in many scripts, but should no longer be given explicitly in sms/config_exp.h
 * It is still possible to give LL=nn on the Harmonie command line, for convenience. This will be interpreted as LL_LIST=nn, and will also override any differences found in harmonie.pm regarding forecast length.
