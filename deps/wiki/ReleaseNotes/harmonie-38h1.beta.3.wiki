== Description of Harmonie 38h1 ==

Harmonie 38h1 is HIRLAM's adaptation to the IFS/ARPEGE CY38T1 released in August 2012 and the subsequent bugfix versions 1 to 3. 

At its default, Harmonie-38h1 comprises the following features:

 * A meso-scale NWP forecast system with convection-permitting AROME physics and non-hydrostatic dynamics on a model grid with 2.5 km grid-spacing in horizontal and 65 vertical levels.
 * Treatment of surface processes by SURFEX
 * 3D-VAR upper air assimilation with 3h cycling
 * Optimal interpolation-based surface analysis using CANARI for the spatialization and SODA for the update of surface variables.
 * A comprehensive set of utilities for observation preprocessing, model diagnostics, monitoring and verification.
 * A scheduler, mSMS, and a graphical interface, mXCdp, for running an controlling the full suite.

 The main differences between beta.2 and beta.3 are summarized in the list below. For a full list of changes please look at the [https://hirlam.org/trac/log/trunk/harmonie/?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=12418&stop_rev=12139&limit=500 change log].

 * Easier output of 2D diagnostics fields [12371]
 * Improved initialisation for the initial surfex state.
 * Separate evaluation of liquid/sold microphysics, switched off, experimental
 * A number of smaller bug fixes and improvements in the diagnostics, scripts and verification environment

=== Difference between CY38T1 and harmonie-38h1 ===

 harmonie-cy38h1 contains a number of developments not introduced in or done after the release of CY38T1. The difference between harmonie-38h1.beta.3 and CY38T1_bf.03 can be summarized as:

 * Satellite BUFR file decoding in Bator and treatment of empty pools
 * ATOVS blacklisting and VARBC predictor treatment
 * IO-server changes, IO optimization ( some backporting from CY39T1)
 * SURFEX FA format file manipulation tools. ( backporting from CY39T1 )
 * Ability to run SODA inline CANARI
 * Use different cloud droplet number concentration depending on land/sea/town for cloud sedimentation
 * Added OpenMP directives in SURFEX related parts
 * Changed weights between land/sea for T2M diagnostics
 * Snow analysis changes
 * Update of SURFEX SST from the boundary files, for climate simulations
 * Fix for running BE04 option in SURFEX.
 * Easier output of 2D diagnostics fields [12371]
