== Description of Harmonie 40h1 ==

Harmonie 40h1 is HIRLAM's adaptation to the IFS/ARPEGE CY40T1 released in April 2014 and the subsequent bugfix versions 1 to 5 and after rc1 aceptance tests. 

At its default, Harmonie-40h1 comprises the following features:

 * A meso-scale NWP forecasting deterministic system with non-hydrostatic dynamics on a model grid with 2.5 km grid-spacing in horizontal and 65 vertical levels.
 * Two choices of convection-permitting atmospheric physics packages: AROME or ALARO
 * Treatment of surface processes by SURFEX
 * 3D-VAR upper air assimilation with 3h cycling using conventional observations and AMSUA AMSUB/MHS satellite information.
 * Optimal interpolation-based surface analysis using CANARI for the spatialization and SODA for the update of surface variables.
 * A comprehensive set of utilities for observation preprocessing, model diagnostics, monitoring and verification.
 * A scheduler, mSMS, and a graphical interface, mXCdp, for running an controlling the full suite.
 * An ensemble system configuration, HarmonEPS including 10+1 AROME and 10+1 ALARO members running on 2.5km.
