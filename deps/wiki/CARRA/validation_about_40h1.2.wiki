This page collects validation results about CARRA reanalysis system in terms of intercomparison against observation, different model versions, configurations, operational archives.


== Validation ==

=== Preparation phase towards CARRA baseline ===

Based on agreement in the CARRA kickoff meeting on Sept 27 2017, validation runs are to be made using Harmonie 40h1.1 and 40h1.2 before end of October 2017 in order to decide baseline version as CARRA re-analysis system. 

Models are to be validated on both of the targeted CARRA domains for the month of Sept 2017. Optionally the test can include also additional historical periods.

For CARRA-SW domain (IGB) the initial configurations are following, in consistence to the settings used in the operational DMI-IMO IGA
 * blending mode with 6h cycling
 * quadratic grid
 * ocndt2=.false.
 * for 40h1.2, a configuration of SICE, 1 patche and no SBL have been selected.
 * Summary about the tested setup during the preparation phase.
    * Although the test was meant to use corrected PGD data,  due to mistake the default ECCOCLIMAP II data from the reference 40h1.1 has been used. A correction has since been made with rerun using PGD data. Comparison herein highlight sensitivity/benefit of updating PGD data
    * Test has also been made using 40h1.2 but with options more close to [https://hirlam.org/portal/validation/40h1/IGBcarra_1_a_40h12 40h1.1 (LSBL, in green) ]
    * Paralle test for selected summer and winter months in 2017, also Nov 2012 to examine sensitivity of LBC and [https://hirlam.org/portal/validation/40h1/IGBcarra_ERA5_2012/ compare to ERA5.] Red with ERA5 boundary, Green with ECMWF operational analysis, blue with 6h lagged forecast, magenda from ERA5.
For CARRA-NE domain (AA) the initial domain is the same as AROME-arctic with following setup,
 * 3DVAR with 3h cycling
 * Linear grid
 * ocndt2=.true.
 * ECCOCLIMAP II for PGD
 * for 40h1.2, a configuration of SICE, 2 patches and no SBL have been selected.
 * Summary about the tested setup during the preparation phase.
   * Initial test suffers error in setup about VarBC cold start and environment setup. 
   * Parallel test for autumn episode with corrected setup in which 40h1.2 run is made with 40h1.1-like options for [https://hirlam.org/portal/validation/40h1/AAcarra2_s_40h12 intercomparison to 40h1.1 to see reproducibility]
