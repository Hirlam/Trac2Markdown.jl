== Description of CARRA.alpha.1 ==
CARRA.alpha.1 is a technical code repository dedicated to development of the CARRA re-analysis system. The repository was branched off from the HARMONIE trunk dated Oct 12 2017 at changeset [16325] and adapted for the CARRA needs. From meteorological point of view the carra.alpha.1 is very close to the candidate settings for the coming Harmonie-40h1.2 by HIRLAM-C consortia.

By its default CARRA.alpha.1 features
 * A meso-scale NWP deterministic forecast system with non-hydrostatic dynamics on a model-grid with 2.5 km grid-spacing in horizontal and 65 vertical level with bottom at 12 m and top at 10 hpa
 * A convection-permitting atmospheric physics packages (HARMONIE-AROME) with HARATO turbulence parameterisation, EDMFM shallow convection with mixed phase microphysics option OCND2, IFS radiation
 * An quadratic grid type in terms of spectral truncation to grid point space, and vertical boundary relaxation LUNBC
 * Surface parameterisation with SURFEX 7.3 with optional two patch scheme, and a simple sea ice model (SICE)
 * 3D-VAR upper air assimilation with 3h cycling, enabling assimilation of conventional observation and microwave radiance (with VarBc), AMV wind, scatterometer wind, radio occultation bending angel data.
 * Optimal interpolation-based surface analysis using CANARI for spatialization and SODA/OI-main for the update of soil variables
 * Use of ECMWF ERA5 hourly analysis as lateral boundary in forecast integration, and use of ECMWF large scale through spectral nudging for background in 3DVAR (LSMIX)
 * Use of GMTED2010 250 m resolution orographic dataset and ECCOCLIMAP II PGD data with local improvement over Iceland and Greenland
 * Use ECMWF HPC (Cray XC40), gnu compiler and forecast integration with MPI parallelisation 
 * HARMONIE utilities for observation preprocessing, model diagnostics, monitoring and verification.
 * A job scheduler with ecflow.
The full list of CARRA code changes on top of the original HARMONIE-trunk can be found in the following [https://hirlam.org/trac/log/branches/CARRA/harmonie-40h1.2_carra?rev=16574 wiki listing].
=== Anticipated development efforts toward final CARRA system and release plan ===
It is expected that the CARRA re-analysis system system will go through further changes associated with activities as listed below, which will lead to several more intermediate system releases toward start of CARRA production in mid-2019. To commit future code corrections or updates, please use code branch https://svn.hirlam.org/branches/CARRA/harmonie-40h1.2_carra
 * Upper air data assimilation
  * Control of large scale information (Jk vs LSMIX)
  * Derivation of climatological structure function with EDA or Brand scheme
  * Use of evolving structure functions to partly account for changes of observation system
  * Provide a measure of uncertainties for through EDA for selected episodes
  * Assimilation of Radiance, AMV, Scatterometer, RO data
  * Application of VarBC for aircraft data
  * Use of ECMWF MARS data stream and use of blacklist information
  * Use of locally collected observation data
 * Surface data assimilation and representation of sea/ice states
  * Use of locally collected surface observation data including those of snow
  * Use of high resolution regional SST/ice fraction analysis data
 * Forecast model
  * Exploration of improved snow parameterisation and handling of glacier ice
  * Improvement in PGD data including local corrections
  * Test/tuning about physical parameterisation: two patches/Canopy scheme, SSO, ocnd2, microphysics.
  * Code optimisation (optimal use of compilor/options, i/o server, hybrid parallelisation)
  * Development and adpatation about output data stream
  * HARMONIE on extended domain covering North Polar with changed projection
  * Alternatice compiler/compilation and parallelisation options
 * Verification and validation
  * CARRA production monitoring/diagnosis platform
  * Collection of station information and extended observation data for verification
  * Field verification
Next CARRA code release, carra.beta.1, is scheduled for end April 2018.
Release candidate of carra.rc.1, is expected by end Dec 2018.
Final release of CARRA repository, carra.1, is expected by mid-April 2019.
== Tested configurations ==
The following configurations have been tested and are working technically.
 * AROME_ARCTIC_3DVAR: 3DVAR on AROME_ARCTIC domain, linear grid
 * CARRA_NE domain: blending on CARRA_NE domain, quadratic grid
 * IGB_3DVAR: 3DVAR on IGB/CARRA_SW domain
 * IGB_blending: blending on IGB_CARRA domain
== Experiment Configuration ==
Users are referred to the system wiki documentation about [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/Installation Information and Instruction on basic system installation and experiment configuration] and to the [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieSystemDocumentation Harmonie system documentation] for running an experiment at ECMWF.
The steps to set up an experiment on ecgb/cca is:
{{{
~hlam/Harmonie setup -r ~nhe/CARRA_repository/tags/carra.alpha.1 -c $config-option   ## where config-option = CARRA_NE_blending, AROME_ARCTIC_3DVAR, IGB_blending, IGB_3DVAR
}}}
== Known Issues ==
* Running 3DVAR requires matching structure function, Currently such exists for IGB/CARRA_SW and AROME_ARCTIC domains but not for CARRA_NE domain
* The script "Fetch_assim_data" from the recent trunk version had been buggy in connection of fetching of VARBC.cycle for radiance data assimilation. Be careful when testing 3DVAR.
* PGD/soil database for CARRA_NE and CARRA_SW are currently different
