== CARRA system repository ==

 * !20181223: Tagging of CARRA beta.2, the updated system baseline for CARRA, see system information about [wiki:CARRA.beta.2 carra.beta.2]. It is recommended to launch beta.2 experiments with St script. See wiki [wiki:CARRA.beta.2 carra.beta.2] about this.
  * The sandbox on ECMWF hpc is in
    * ~nhx/CARRA_repository/tags/carra.beta.2
 * !20181025: Tagging of CARRA beta.1, the new system baseline for CARRA, see system information about [wiki:CARRA.beta.1 carra.beta.1]
 * !20180704: Tagging of CARRA technical baseline, see [wiki:CARRA/CARRA.alpha.2 Releasenote of carra.alpha.2]
 * !20171220: Tagging of CARRA system baseline, see [wiki:CARRA/CARRA.alpha.1 Releasenote of carra.alpha.1] !!! It is now obsolete

== Development of CARRA re-analysis system ==
=== Preparation phase (Sept - Dec 2017)  ===
 * Following decisions from the CARRA kickoff meeting on Sept 27 2017, preliminary CARRA code branches are established to enable validation runs to select between Harmonie 40h1.1 and 40h1.2/trunk a CARRA system baseline. Models are validated on both of the targeted CARRA domains for the month of Sept 2017. Optionally the tests can include additional historical periods.
 *For CARRA-SW domain (IGB) the initial configurations are following, in consistence to the settings used in the operational DMI-IMO IGA
{{{
   blending at 6h interval
   quadratic grid
   lcond=.false.
   HWSD soil database 
   for 40h1.2, a configuration of SICE, 1 patche and no SBL have been selected.
}}}
 * For CARRA-NE domain (AA) the initial domain is the same as AROME-arctic with following setup,
{{{
   3DVAR with 3h cycling
   Linear grid
   for 40h1.2, a configuration of SICE, 2 patches and no SBL have been selected.
}}}
 * [wiki:CARRA/validation_about_40h1.2 Collection of validation about 40h1.1 vs 40h1.2] 

=== From CARRA alpha (Dec 21 2017) to CARRA beta.1 (Sept 2018)  ===
Following aspects are to be addressed toward final version of CARRA re-analysis system
 * Upper air data assimilation
  * Control of large scale information (Jk vs LSMIX)
  * Derivation of climatological structure function; with EDA or BRAND scheme
  * Possible use of evolving structure functions to partially account for changes of observation system
  * Provide a measure of uncertainties for through EDA for selected episodes
  * Assimilation of Radiance data, AMV, Scatterometer, RO
  * Application of VarBC for aircraft data
  * Use of ECMWF ERA5/MARS data stream and use of blacklist information
  * Use of locally collected observation data
 * Surface data assimilation and representation of sea/ice states
  * Use of locally collected surface observation data including those of snow
  * Use of high resolution regional SST/ice data
 * Forecast model
  * Exploration of improved snow parameterisation and handling of glacier ice
  * Improvement in PGD data including local corrections
  * Test/tuning about physical parameterisation: two patches/Canopy scheme, SSO, ocnd2, microphysics.
  * Code optimisation (optimal use of compilor/options, i/o server, hybrid parallelisation)
  * Development and adpatation about output data stream and data storage into MARS
  * HARMONIE on extended domain covering North Polar with changed projection
 * Verification and validation
  * CARRA production monitoring/diagnosis platform
  * Collection of station information and extended observation data for verification
  * Field verification
=== From CARRA beta.1 (Oct 25 2018) to CARRA beta.2 (mid Dec 2018)  ===
Following aspects are yet to be finalised toward next version of CARRA re-analysis system
 * Upper air data assimilation
