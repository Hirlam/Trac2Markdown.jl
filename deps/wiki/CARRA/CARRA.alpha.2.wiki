== Description of CARRA.alpha.1 ==
CARRA.alpha.2 is an intermediate code repository toward CARRA-beta due in Sept 2018. The repository was branched off from the CARRA development branch dated July 4 2018 at changeset [17367]. From meteorological point of view the carra.alpha.2 is equivalent to carra.alpha.1, with main changes in technical adaptation to enable test of several candidates components designed for carra-beta, such as assimilation of ATOVS/MSU/AMV, use of high resolution SST and ICE data adapted from reprocessed OSI-SAF data, etc.

By its default CARRA.alpha.2 features
 * A meso-scale NWP deterministic forecast system with non-hydrostatic dynamics on a model-grid with 2.5 km grid-spacing in horizontal and 65 vertical level with bottom at 12 m and top at 10 hpa
 * A convection-permitting atmospheric physics packages (HARMONIE-AROME) with HARATO turbulence parameterisation, EDMFM shallow convection with mixed phase microphysics option OCND2, IFS radiation
 * A selection of linear, quadratic or cubic grid types in terms of spectral truncation to grid point space, and vertical boundary relaxation LUNBC
 * Surface parameterisation with SURFEX 7.3 with optional two patch scheme, and a simple sea ice model (SICE)
 * 3D-VAR upper air assimilation with 3h cycling, enabling assimilation of conventional observation and microwave radiance (with VarBc), AMV wind, scatterometer wind, radio occultation bending angel data.
 * Optimal interpolation-based surface analysis using CANARI for spatialization and SODA/OI-main for the update of soil variables
 * Use of ECMWF ERA5 hourly analysis as lateral boundary in forecast integration, and use of ECMWF large scale through spectral nudging for background in 3DVAR (LSMIX)
 * Use of GMTED2010 250 m resolution orographic dataset and ECCOCLIMAP II PGD data with local improvement over Iceland and Greenland
 * Use ECMWF HPC (Cray XC40), gnu compiler and forecast integration with MPI parallelisation 
 * HARMONIE utilities for observation preprocessing, model diagnostics, monitoring and verification.
 * A job scheduler with ecflow.
The full list of CARRA code changes on top of the original HARMONIE-trunk can be found in the following [https://hirlam.org/trac/log/branches/CARRA/carra?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=17367&stop_rev=16575&limit=100 wiki listing].
=== Anticipated development efforts toward final CARRA system and release plan ===
It is planned that in the coming months a series of parallel experimentation will be made to find the final re-analysis system for CARRA, taking the meteoroloigcal baseline as defined as carra-alpha.2. Based on results from these, CARRA re-analysis system is expected to go through further updates, which will lead to a tagging of intermediate CARRA-versions of carra-beta (Sept 2018) and carra-rc (release Candidates) in Dec 2018. To commit future code corrections or updates, please use [https://hirlam.org/trac/log/branches/CARRA/carra carra development branch). The test activities are mainly around following aspects,  
 * Upper air data assimilation
  * Control of large scale information (Jk vs LSMIX)
  * Derivation of climatological structure function with EDA or Brand scheme
  * Use of evolving structure functions to partly account for changes of observation system
  * Provide a measure of uncertainties for through EDA for selected episodes
  * Assimilation of Radiance, AMV, Scatterometer, RO data
  * Application of VarBC for aircraft data
  * Use of ECMWF MARS data stream and use of blacklist information
  * Use of locally collected observation data
 * Surface data assimilation and representation of sea/ice states
  * Use of locally collected surface observation data including those of snow
  * Use of high resolution regional SST/ice fraction analysis data
 * Forecast model
  * Improved snow parameterisation and handling of glacier ice
  * Improvement in PGD data including local corrections
  * Test/tuning about physical parameterisation: two patches/Canopy scheme, SSO, ocnd2, microphysics.
  * Code optimisation (optimal use of compilor/options, i/o server, hybrid parallelisation)
  * Development and adaptation about output data stream
  * HARMONIE on extended domain covering North Polar with changed projection
  * Alternative compiler/compilation and parallelisation options
 * Verification and validation
  * CARRA production monitoring/diagnosis platform
  * Collection of station information and extended observation data for verification
  * Field verification
Next CARRA code release, carra.beta.1, is scheduled for Sept 2018.
Release candidate of carra.rc.1, is expected by end Dec 2018.
Final release of CARRA repository, carra.1, is expected by mid-April 2019.
== Tested configurations ==
The following configurations have been tested and are working technically.
 * AROME_ARCTIC_3DVAR: 3DVAR on AROME_ARCTIC domain, linear grid
 * IGB_3DVAR: 3DVAR on IGB/CARRA_SW domain
== Experiment Configuration ==
Users are referred to the system wiki documentation about [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/Installation Information and Instruction on basic system installation and experiment configuration] and to the [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieSystemDocumentation Harmonie system documentation] for running an experiment at ECMWF.
The steps to set up an experiment on ecgb/cca is:
{{{
~hlam/Harmonie setup -r ~nhe/CARRA_repository/tags/carra.alpha.2 -c $config-option   ## where config-option = AROME_ARCTIC_3DVAR (default), IGB_3DVAR
}}}
If you want to run a month-long period with 10 additional days for warmup, following is example of launching command
{{{
~hlam/Harmonie start DTG=1999122000 DTGEND=2000013121 WARMUP_PERIOD=10
}}}
