= '''HIRLAM models in routine operation at ''met.no'' ''' =

All HIRLAM models run routinely at ''met.no'' are now based on reference
version 7.1.4, with some local modifications. The horisontal extent of the
domains are shown in the figure below.  The table summarizes some of the key
features.

=== Surface Analysis ===

SST and Sea ice cover are taken directly from OSISAF data
(in a preprocessing step) instead of being analysed by {{{Span}}}.

=== Upper Air Analysis ===

3DVAR assimilation is done in both '''H12''' and '''H08''', but increments
are at half the model resolution. Data used include AMSU-A over sea and
!QuikScat winds (when the instrument worked) in addition to conventional data.

=== Forecast model ===

The standard FFT-based Helmholtz solver (for the semi-implicit correction) has
been replaced by an iterative solver developed locally at ''met.no''. With
this, the simple prime number factorization constraint on NLON is avoided,
which would otherwise lead to unacceptably large numbers of passive boundary
points at the desired resolution and area extent.

=== Post-Processing ===

The pp-streams have (following earlier local versions) been totally modified
to suit local needs.
 
=== Verification ===

The reference verification system is not used. Model results are interpolated
to a predefined number of observation positions and this is put into an
Oracle data base together with the observation data. The verification system
then makes SQL queries to the Oracle DB.
