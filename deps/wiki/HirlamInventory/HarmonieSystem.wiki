== '''DMI''' ==

DMI is running '''CY36h1.4bf1''' with :

 * '''GLA'''    NUUK-arome, blending, 2 km, 65 levels, 4 times a day, DT=30s, ''+36h'', ECMWF LBC with hourly frequency. This is operational suite.

Seen Problems :

 * GLA run was run with DT=45s until December 2011 when it experienced crashes presumably associated with stormy weather. It was afterwards reduced to 30s

In addition, since Dec 2012, DMI runs a '''CY37h1.2''' quasi-operational AROME suite with:
* '''DKA37'''    800x600x65 domain centered around Denmark, 3DVAR with LSMIXBC and asynoptic base time, 8 times a day, DT=60s, ''+58h'', ECMWF LBC with hourly frequency
and it still maintains a corresponding '''CY36h1.4''' time suite with same model domain:

 * '''DKA'''    800x600x65 domain centered around Denmark, blending,  4 times a day, DT=60s, ''+36h'', , ECMWF LBC with hourly frequency

== '''SMHI''' ==


SMHI is running '''CY37h1.1''' :
 ( preoperational since 20120717 )

 * Physics: '''AROME'''
 * Domain: !MetCoOp-Hires2 , 2.5 km, 750x960x65  
 * 3DVAR, SURFEX
 * 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC +36 hours

Problems :

== '''FMI''' ==

FMI is running '''CY36h14''' with :

 * '''AROME''' Finland 2.5km, 300x600 points, 65 levels. 4 times/day, 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC ''+36h'' 
 * Parallel phase since July 2011. Operational 14 Dec 2011.
 * 3D-VAR + OI_MAIN with conventional observations.
 * AROME physics including EDMFM

Nesting :

 * Boundary conditions from IFS, 3-hourly 

Problems :

 * Wind speed underestimated over land areas (especially in northern part of Finland)
 * Too warm night-time temperature in summer/autumn.
 * Winter-time "Nordic temperature problem".

Successes :
 
 * Precipitation structure has received good feedback.
 * Good performance in several late autumn/early winter convective cases. 

Verification:

 * '''HIRLAM'''/'''Harmonie''' verification at http://fminwp.fmi.fi/WebgraF/FMI-HARMONIE
 * Mast verification at Sodankylä http://fminwp.fmi.fi/mastverifnew/

== '''KNMI''' ==

KNMI is running '''CY36h14''' with

 * '''AROME''' Netherlands (800x800), 60 levels (Meteo France definition). Eight times a day, ''+24h''
 * Wall clock time 1h05m, forecast 33m on 552 processors (1/8 of KNMI Bull computer)
 * 3D-VAR HARMONIE analysis
 * Runs started ~ 1 December 2011, data assimilation working properly ~ 10 January
 * AROME physics including EDMFM

Nesting :

 * HIRLAM - H11(11km) --> AROME (2.5km) 

Problems :

 * Cloud base too low, too many high clouds
 * Wind gusts may be a little bit too high in convection, warm sector gusts OK.
 * Fullpos not working because of memory requirements

Successes :
 
 * Very good guidance in dynamic weather cases (line convection in cold front, wind gusts)

== '''AEMET''' ==

''warning: following information is outdated, need update!!!''

AEMET is running '''CY32h2''' on CrayX1E platform with :

 * '''ALADIN''' IBERIA (384x400), 11km, 40 levels. Once a day, 00 UTC ''+30h''
 * '''AROME''' MEDITERRANEAN AREA (300x300), 2.5km, 40 levels. Once a day, 00 UTC ''+30h''
 
Nesting :

 * HIRLAM (17km) --> ALADIN (11km) --> AROME (2.5km)


== ''' Met Éireann''' ==
=== met.ie Summary ===

 * Harmonie version: '''37h1.1'''
 * Domain: Ireland + UK, '''IRELAND25''', 540x500 points, 2.5km grid-spacing
 * Dynamics: '''non-hydrostatic'''
 * Physics+surface: '''AROME''' + '''SURFEX'''
 * Initialisation: ANAATMO='''blending''', ANASURF='''CANARI_OI_MAIN''', FCINT='''06'''
 * Forecast length: 30hr
 * Cycles: 4 - 00, 06, 12, 18
 * Cut-off: ca. 2hr40min (runs once HIRLAM I10 same_forecast files are available)
   - it is planned to run Harmonie before HIRLAM with a ~1hr00min cut-off soon
 * Nesting : IFS --> AROME (2.5km)



=== 36h1.3 problems ===
 * Large number of Listener tasks was suspected to have caused crashes caused by failed ''ls'' and ''cat'' commands. Setting taskmax to 10 seems to have helped with this problem.
 * One model crash in August 2011 related to strong upper air winds required a change in time-step to 45s for a couple of cycles.

=== 37h1.1 problems ===
 * Issues with file-system response to ''ls'' and ''cat'' commands persist
 * Suspect quick md5sum checks have misdiagnosed completed writing of forecast files

Plans:
 * Evaluate to 3DVAR with 37h1
 * Evaluate 38h1 (for operational use) once tagged

== '''MF''' ==

''warning: following information is outdated, need update!!!''

MF is running '''CY31t2''' with

 * '''AROME''' South-west of France 2.5km (240x240), 41 levels. Once a day, 00 ''+30h''
 * Initialized from interpolated ALADIN analysis (3D-VAR). No meso-scale DA yet.

Problems :

 * AROME is too cold and dry during night-time. Day-time is OK.
 * Coupling problems: convergence in boundary region --> spurious rain amounts.
 * AROME is not always able to present weak precipitation amounts (about 0-4 mm/12h) well. 

Near furure:

 * Moving to NEC platform --> Area enlarged to cover whole France.
 * CY32t1
   * Hail included.
   * Microphysics enhancements for low clouds (fog).
   * New cloud scheme + EDKF for shallow convection.

   http://www.hirlam.org/index.php?option=com_kunena&Itemid=160&func=view&catid=2&id=1049#1059
 * "Nordic temperature problem" also seen in winter time.
