== Current forecast model output with the Reference HIRLAM ==

The HIRLAM forecast model writes its primary output to a so called history file (fcyyyymmdd_hh+lll), containing full model state which can enable re-start of forecast if necessary, as well as the fields for model diagnostics (fcyyyymmdd_hh+lllmd). For FMI-RCR, these data are archived at 1 hour interval up to 9 hour forecast, and at 3 hours intervals from there on. Fields for verification are written to a file with suffix `ve' (fcyyyymmdd_hh+lllve), at 3 hours intervals. 

A complete listing of the output parameters from the Reference HIRLAM system is [http://fminwp.fmi.fi/docs/Hirlam_Archives.html available here]

== Potential additional products ==

Apart from the additional post-PP products as listed above, following quantities may also be of interests, all of them directly derivable from the the existing HIRLAM model paramters:

 * [http://www.knmi.nl/~tijm/postproc/postproc.html Satellite imagery (MSG types of images)]
 * Radar reflectivity
 
Examples of some of these products can be found through:
