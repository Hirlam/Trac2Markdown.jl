== Logged out ==

You have been logged out of the access restricted part of https://hirlam.org

[[Timestamp]]

!Logout/Login sometimes does not work as intended in Trac on the new hirlam.org server.

As a workaround, if you need to log in as a different user, change your URL slightly
in the browser, to something like this:
{{{
#!text/html
https://username@hirlam.org/trac/login
}}}
where ''username'' is the new username you want to use.

You may also have to press Login again, or possibly Cancel if you get a new login window
after giving your username and password.

If you still have problems, you may have to restart your browser.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
