== Subversion Q & A ==

 * What do I need to do to run HIRLAM-A releases using Subversion?
 * How do I manage my personal development versions?
 * How can I get a list of branches and tags
 * What has become easier with managing branch using svn?
    * An excerpt testimony from researchers at WRF project:
      * CVS limitations:
        * Cannot follow history through file renaming/directory.  This makes merging and updating much more difficult and error-prone. Merging is a common operation when working with branches.
        * Cannot ask CVS where a branch started from or what version of the main trunk it has been updated to.  Users must maintain this metadata separately.  Another common source of errors when using branches.
        * Time required for CVS many operations is proportional to repository size, not size of the changes.  This will become a bigger problem as we integrate wrfvar and WRF repositories and add more NMM code.
        * Output from "cvs diff" can be rather difficult for humans to parse. Thus the need for tools like "diffcvs".
