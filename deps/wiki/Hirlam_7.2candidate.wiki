This page contains information about relevant code updates recently included into the trunk of the HIRLAM repository, targeted for the next version of HIRLAM system, HIRLAM 7.2.

== New Features in the trunk targeted for Hirlam 7.2 ==

The trunk version contains following updates which are targeted for 7.2
 * __Modification of verification procedure__ The verification procedure is modified to enhance its application in model intercomparison. The new method involves a two-step procedure in model validation against in-situ observation data (such as SYNOP and TEMP data). Model data for each forecast cycle are first interpolated to observation points and archived. Second, aggregation of verification scores for one or several model runs are obtained by comparing model data on observation points to a uniquely defined, quality controlled observation data set. The modification of precedure eliminates previous dependency of verification results to on-line or off-line verification approaches, and ensure consistent quality control and data selection in calculation of observation verification scores in case of multi-model intercomparison. (Eerola, changset [5221],[5222],[5223])
 * __Automatic calculation of observation data array__ Instead of hard-coding, the dimensions for observation arrays plen, nobsh_local, nobsh_hi, plen can now be calculated from actual observation data (CMA file) sizes and thereby avoid waste of memory space (Lindskog, changeset [5147])
 * __Improvement in minimisation at VarQC start and end__by resetting search direction to steepest descent when cost function changes in  conneciton with on and off of variational quality control. (Vignes, [5247])
 * __Update of radar radial wind observation operator__ Beamwidth is now derived from observation file instead of assuming one-degree one-way beamwidth; The code now supports two-way radar beamwidth. (Salones, [5183],[5193])
 * __Cleanup of the Hirlam physics__in order to minimize the differences between Hirlam and ALADIN versions. (Wilhelmsson and Niemela, [5126],[5127])
