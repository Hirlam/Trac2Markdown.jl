== Status with respect to Rolling Work Plan for Surface analysis and modelling ==

> '''Status notes are indicated like this.'''

=== SU1: Introduce and assess more advanced data assimilation algorithms in SODA framework ===

 * Develop/assess EKF for soil and snow using SYNOP data in combination with the Force-restore soil and the new Explicit Snow (ES) scheme.
   * Priority: High. Staff: Mariken Homleid (1pm, !MetCoOp*), Karl-Ivar Ivarsson (1pm), Patrick Samuelsson (0.5pm, !MetCoOp*), Magnus Lindskog (IMPREX*), Trygve Aspelien (NVE Avalanche project*)
   > Magnus is currently evaluating his test simulations over south-west Europe with respect to how activation of OI/EKF and CANARI/MESCAN settings affect precipitation patterns.
   >
   > See interesting results/conclusions by Jelena under SU5 below.
   >
   > Trygve has continued to develop the python package offline-surfex-forcing (see [https://github.com/metno/offline-surfex-forcing]). He has now used it to prepare forcing from HARMONIE-AROME for points and for grids. The forcing has been used in the offline version of SURFEX made technically available by Trygve in branch harmonie-40h1.2_EKF. Results of these offline simulations are presented by Trygve at upcoming HIRLAM meetings.
   >
   > Patrick has not had any time yet to analyse the Surface-EKF experiments he did over a !MetCoOp domain...

 * Start assessment of MESCAN versus CANARI, and investigate sensitivity of anisotropic horizontal/vertical structure functions.
   * Priority: High. Staff: Mariken Homleid (0.5pm) 
   > Mariken has continued to work on MESCAN tests. Overview and summary of MESCAN experiments on a domain covering Sweden and Norway and link to summary statistics for July, October and December 2016 is found [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/MESCAN_tests here]. 
    * Further develop snow analysis and assimilation of snow in CANARI/MESCAN/SODA.
   * Priority: High. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (3pm, !MetCoOp*)
   > No practical activity yet. However unplanned activity of writing a large proposal to Finnish Academy. The proposal is devoted to assimilation of satellite data on snow into NWP. Both visual and microwave radiometry is in its frames.     
   
 * Develop/assess EKF for sea ice, using satellite products in combination with the SICE scheme. 
   * Priority: Low. Staff: Bin Cheng (INTAROS*, TWASE*), Yurii Batrak (PhD work*)
   > No activity I guess...?

=== SU2: Introduce and assess new surface observations ===

 * Identify retrieval products (satellite/instrument) to use for each model variable ([wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/Satellite_list Satellite list]), with a main  focus on soil moisture, snow cover, snow water equivalent and sea ice cover. Implement product reading/processing in CANARI/MESCAN or in parallel and connect each product to a corresponding SURFEX variable in the SODA/EKF framework (see SU1):
   * Snow extent satellite products
	* Priority: High. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (1pm)
        > Candidates for snow extent satellite products are defined: these are EUMETSAT HSAF H31 (MSG/SEVIRI) and EUMETSAT HSAF H32 (METOP/AVHRR) products. First, to start with H31 and then hopefully to add H32. For technical part (reading, etc.) no activities yet. 
   * Sea-ice extent and sea-ice drift products.
	* Priority: Low. Staff: Yurii Batrak (PhD work*), Bin Cheng (INTAROS*, TWASE*)
        > Bin says:
{{{
1) I am currently working on SIMBA automated algorithm development with colleagues from China.
We made conference paper early this year and one manuscript is under final preparation.
The algorithm works reasonable for the Arctic condition. See conference paper as ISOSPO_Japan_Liao_eta_real_final.pdf in attachments.
2) We also did a modelling paper using historical ice mass balance data. See DOI: 10.1007/s13131-017-1020-4.
3) We have made several attempt for SIMBA deployment in the Arctic in 2017. Some activity are
successful (with China) and some are failed (with Russia). More SIMBA will be deployed in the Arctic
in 2018 as part of INTAROS project.
4) The ice extent product for the Arctic is not yet ready and we are working on it.
Are we planning to provide sea-ice drift products? I thought it is the sea ice thickness products?
5) Some joint studies with Yurii is under construction.

=== SU3: Explore and validate available SURFEX physics components: ===

 * Test and validate the behaviour of the full combination of DIF, ES and (MEB), with respect to the older soil and snow schemes, with focus on optimizing SURFEX options and parameter values. To start these experiments as soon as possible, use will be initially be made of Cy43 without data assimilation (i.e. in climate mode). Utilize a combination of offline SURFEX, MUSC, and the full 3D model depending on the type of study.
   * Priority: High. Staff: John de Vries (5pm), Samuel Viana (4pm), Nikolai Nawri (1pm, Icelandic external projects with snow focus ~4 pm*), Sigurdur Thorsteinsson (1pm), Trygve Aspelien (NVE Avalanche project*), Åsmund Bakketun (Master thesis at !MetNorway*)
   > Samuel has made a few test experiments with HARMONIE-Climate using the SURFEX wish list of SURFEXv8 options as far as possible. Plans are now to go ahead with similar climate simulations with cy43h as soon we have an updated SURFEXv8.1 code available within the HARMONIE repository. [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/DIF_versus_Force_restore See memory notes from a Google Hangouts meeting on this issue here.] Since the hangout Samuels says...
{{{
I've been gathering climate data to compare our future cy43h 2.5km climate runs with the surfex wishlist options as we discussed. So far I'm planning to
use Harmonie 11km simulations from the UERRA project for T2m,Mspl, etc. and a local 50 years, 5km resolution precipitation analysis in Spain developed by AEMET.
My idea is to follow the paper by Lindstedt et al. ( http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v67.24138 ) to produce similar figures to check for model biases.
I have ready some scripts to compare model & analysis data once I can start the simulations. I would appreciate any help & ideas on how to design the
experiments and also on how to focus more the analysis on surface-related processes.
}}}
   >
   > Patrick is working on merging SURFEXv8.0 + Météo-France SURFEX updates + latest SURFEX team updates to create a cy43h version with SURFEX up to date.
   >
   > A telecon meeting between John, Bart van den Hurk and Patrick took place July 13 on how to proceed for John with Parameter calibration of ISBA. Since then, John says: I am still finalizing the list of parameters and producing code to use them in the sensitivity analysis and calibration. I am working on some changes to the SURFEX offline system because the soil moisture evolution was not close enough to Harmonie output.

 * Activate lake model FLake (without data assimilation).
   * Priority: high. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (2pm)
   > The lake experiments are finished and results look promising. [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/Surface_status_September_2017/MetCoOp0709.pdf Katya has analysed some of the results. Look here...]. Clear improvement of T2M STDV with FLAKE. Still some problems related to reproduce WATFLX simulations in cy40h1.2 after FLake code has been updated. Daniel and Katya are looking into this...

=== SU4: Further develop SURFEX surface model components ===

 * Further improve aspects of SICE as e.g. snow on ice, prognostic ice thickness and ice drift functionality.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Yurii Batrak (PhD work*), Bin Cheng (0.5pm)
   > Yurii is currently working on implementing SICE into the SURFEX repository. In this way it will become part of a SURFEXv9 release and become available in cy43h.

 * Implementation of FLake modifications/developments into SURFEX repository based on what is currently done in cy40h. Includes modifications of PGD physiography averaging methods.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (2pm)
   > 
   
 * Develop a physically based glacier model for SURFEXv9.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Emily Gleeson (3pm), Bolli Palmason (1pm), Kristian Pagh Nielsen (0.5pm), Ruth Mottram (DMI, Greenland  ice-cap projects*)
   > Next steps will happen at the Surface Working days in Ljubljana.

 * Evaluate the orographic/radiation implementation in Cy43 and apply further modifications/ developments.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Laura Rontu (1pm)
   > No activity yet. Occupied with atmospheric radiation work until September.
   
 * Evaluate and further modify/develop parameterization of orographic momentum fluxes.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Laura Rontu (1pm)
   > No activity yet. Occupied with atmospheric radiation work until September.
   
 * Modification of the SURFEX parameterization of fractional snow in complex terrain.
   * Priority: medium. Staff: Laura Rontu (0.5pm)
   > No activity yet. Occupied with atmospheric radiation work until September.
   

=== SU5: Assess and improve quality of surface characterization: ===

 * Document how MODIS LAI information should be processed to make validation possible for LAI fields over specific domains. Make a work plan for how to correct/adapt these fields where necessary, by either (i) modifying ECOCLIMAP physiography, (ii) implement diagnostic LAI and/or (iii) use STAEKF for updating LAI field locally.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Bolli Palmason (1pm), Jelena Bojarova (UERRA*)
   > Jelena has continued to investigate the behaviour of Jacobians coupled to the LAI update with STAEKF. With evolving B-matrix only deep soil moisture behaves stable but all other variables (top soil moisture and soil temperatures) are more or less problematic. E.g. problems with top soil moisture Jacobians show patterns which are probably connected to precipitation events. Surface temperature is too fast for the linear assumption over three hours assimilation window to be valid. Deep temperature is problematic at some places/occasions. Thus, to be able to use evolving B-matrix we probably need to calculate the Jacobians using the data during the whole three-hour window and not only as a difference between the end and the start. Jelena has also studied EKF behaviour in offline SURFEXv8.1 simulations using 12 patches. Her very preliminary, but still very interesting/important note, is that Jacobian behaviour seems to be less problematic when the active surface/soil processes are separated into patches. Using one patch only to simulate all different processes seem to lead to more problematic Jacobian behaviour. This indicates that we should not try to solve the Jacobian behaviour with one patch but first introduce the physical processes we are interested in before we further investigate the behaviour of the EKF surface assimilation.
   
 * Evaluate/develop TEB specific parameters.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (1pm)
   > No activity yet.
   
 * Coordinate efforts to critically evaluate currently used physiography and gather modifications for updated releases via the SURFEX team at Météo-France.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Patrick Samuelsson (coordination)
   > Samuel Viana says: I have assessed the quality of ECOCLIMAP's water bodies data over Spain, after finding an important number of missing dams in ECOCLIMAPII. I contacted Stèphanie Faroux in order to update the physiography, provided an updated shapefile with the Spanish dams from a government agency and she updated ECOCLIMAPII with that. Currently thinking about running some experiments to check for possible improvements in model performance...
   
 * Follow the Météo-France efforts in the ESA-CCI land cover map process and coordinate with relevant HIRLAM staff.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Patrick Samuelsson (coordination)
   > Ekaterina developed a method (and the routine) to separate between the lake, ocean and river water (unplanned activity). The method is resolution-dependent and needs tuning. It was tested by Margarita Choulga for Globcover to separate between ocean/lake water and hopefully may be useful for the development of ECOCLIMAP SG (however, Stephanie was not contacted yet).   

== Additional work ==

 * Emily Gleeson says: We've been trying to upgrade from harmonie cycle 37, firstly to cycle 38 and now to cycle 40 but both have a significant T2m cold bias. We think it is surfex related as it wasn't present in cycle 37. We've carried out several experiments but have not resolved it yet. Have you any suggestions of what we should tune or alter in Surfex?
  * Patrick suggested to look into the heat capacity of vegetation (CV). Based on experience from Eric Bazile at Météo-France they have tuned the vegetation heat capacity, XDATA_CV in surfex/SURFEX/ini_data_param.F90. They increased the heat capacity by setting all XDATA_CV-values to 0.8E-5... 
  * Emily replies: Setting the XDATA_CV-values to 0.8E-5 improved out T2m bias (but stdev is a bit worse) - we will test this sensitivity a bit more now. [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/Surface_status_September_2017/V_00000000_00000000_ALL_ALL_TT_0.1.png Look at preliminary result here.]
  * Hmhm, cy37 is almost disturbingly good in T2m statistics compared to later cycles... 

 * Patrick has modified tree height for the !MetCoOp domain to look into U10m bias.
   * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/Surface_status_September_2017/Tree_height_report.pdf The modifications are described here.]
   * [https://hirlam.org/portal/validation/40h1/tree_height_z0sn_fall_test_export/ The corresponding firsts test for an autumn period is available here.]

== Comments ==

 * At the [wiki:Meetings/Surface/Surface201709 Ljubljana Workshop] we will be six HIRLAM surface people attending. We will probably look into:
   * The work by Trygve on python package offline-surfex-forcing and how the forcing can be used in the offline version of SURFEX made technically available by Trygve in branch harmonie-40h1.2_EKF. (Trygve...)
   * A climate setup of cy43h and it's connection to SURFEX (new options) (Samuel and Patrick).
   * Glacier development for SURFEX (Emily, Kristian, Bolli)
   * Utilisation of more SURFEX variables in CAN
ARI (Patrick and Trygve)
 * EKF studies are currently done through external projects: Magnus (IMPREX*) and Jelena (UERRA*)
 * Preliminary findings by Jelena on sensitivity of Jacobians to patches may alter priority in surface data assimilation plans by first giving more attention to implementation of processes before detailed EKF behaviour is studied.
 * As Katya says: The lake experiments are finished and results [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/Surface_status_September_2017/MetCoOp0709.pdf look promising]. Clear improvement of T2M STDV with FLake. Katya is currently analysing the results... Still some problems related to reproduce WATFLX simulations in cy40h1.2 after FLake code has been updated. Daniel and Katya are looking into this... 
 * At SMHI we will have a new colleague joining the NWP developing group from end of September. His name is [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lichuan_Wu2 Lichuan Wu]. With us he will continue his research on wave-modelling and our intention is to benefit from his skills to reach an operational implementation of a wave model in HARMONIE-AROME.

== Plans of meetings ==

  * Surface autumn meeting is co-arranged with the LACE Data Assimilation Working Days (DAWD) which will take place in Ljubljana September 18-20.
