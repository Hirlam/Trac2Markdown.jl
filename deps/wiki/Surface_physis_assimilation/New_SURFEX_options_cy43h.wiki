 LTR_ML = .FALSE.  ! Radiative transfer in vegetation (but see LMEB option below).
 NPATCH = 2-4      ! Number of patches. 2 means separate forest and open land. 3 would mean an additional patch with permanent snow (glaciers). 4 would mean yet an additional patch for bare soil)
 LMEB = .TRUE.   ! Use Multi-Energy Balance (explicit canopy). Automatically sets LTR_ML = .TRUE.
 CPEDO_FUNCTION =  'CO84' ! Should be used for DIF

&NAM_SGH_ISBAn  
 CRUNOFF   = 'DT92' ! DT92 means Dumenill and Todini (1992) subgrid runoff (should be used in combination with XUNIF_RUNOFFB=0.2). SGH means Decharme et al. (2006) Topmodel like subgrid runoff. This was developed for coarser resolution and requires subgrid slope information 
 CRAIN    = 'SGH ' ! Activate spatial distribution of rainfall.
 CHORT    = 'DEF'   ! DEF=no Horton runoff. SGH activates the Horton surface runoff for intense rain on dry soil with limited infiltration capacity. This option was added in the climate model: it has to be evaluated carefully for NWP applications before taking the decision of its use.
 LSOC = .TRUE.  ! Activate soil organic carbon effect.
