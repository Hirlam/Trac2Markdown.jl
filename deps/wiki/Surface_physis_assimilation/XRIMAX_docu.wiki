== Background ==

Based on target tests for cy38h XRIMAX was set =0.0, in combination with the canopy model (LISBA_CANOPY=.TRUE.). 
In our strive for better surface physics we took the step in cy40h1.1.1 to activate two patches as an option (forest and open land), NPATCH=2.
But, NPATCH>1 cannot be combined with LISBA_CANOPY=.TRUE. so any setup with NPATCH=2 also needs LISBA_CANOPY=.FALSE.
Then it was shown that the setting XRIMAX=0.0 is not beneficial in combination with LISBA_CANOPY=.FALSE. anymore since it does not
allow a stable surface layer to evolve. Thus, in a release of cy43h2.1, where we activate NPATCH=2 and LISBA_CANOPY=.FALSE. as default settings,
we also need XRIMAX>0. However, it has been difficult to find good results with XRIMAX>0 for all domains and all seasons. Tests are ongoing...

== Preliminary conclusions ==

The combination NPATCH=2 and XRIMAX=0.2 in general seems to be beneficial for mid-southern Europe domains, e.g. KNMI and AEMET domains. However, the Alps
region of the KNMI domain shows problematic behavior in T2m scores with too low T2m. This problem is also seen in most of the !MetCoOp domain during
winter time. The reason for this cold T2m bias is not yet understood. In principle one would expect a warm T2m bias if the model is not allowed to
form stable surface layers but we don't see this. Is it due to compensating errors? Maybe yes, but we currently don't understand why, if so. Thus,
the strategy now is to activate XRIMAX>0 but at the same time avoid a too cold bias to evolve.  

== Follow-up meeting ==

'''A follow-up web meeting to discuss progress with XRIMAX experiments will take place Tuesday December 17th at 10:30-11:30 CET.
Please use this link to join the meeting (should work best with Chrome web browser):'''
[https://my.meetu.se/meet/94917312]

== Plan ==

Based on experience from experiments so far we believe now that the way forward is a combination of 
 * XRIMAX>0, probably =0.2...
 * Modified shape of the exchange coefficients Cm and Ch for the stable case (Ri>0).
 * Modified T2m diagnostics for the stable case.

Possibly also with modified
 * Snow roughness

To understand the surface layer behavior in more detail under stable conditions Patrick and Danijel have been in contact with the Meteorology department at Uppsala University to get data from their [http://celsius.met.uu.se/?pageid=12&meny=7 open-land site Marsta] north of Uppsala. The plan is to have enough data so we can force SURFEX offline and also validate the behavior of surface temperature and the air temperature at a few levels in between the surface and the forcing level.

The plan is to have a combination with XRIMAX>0 as part of a cy43h2.1 release. However, it may happen that we don't reach a common good combination for all domains and seasons before a release is required. If so, some recommendations to test for your domains will be documented.

=== XRIMAX ===

Some tests are done with XRIMAX=0.2 and some with XRIMAX=0.5. Probably XRIMAX=0.2 will be the one we go for 
https://hirlam.org/portal/kpn/SBL_diag_201911_export/
=== Exchange coefficients Cm and Ch ===

The exchange coefficient for momentum flux, Cm, is specified in subroutine [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/Harmonie/src/surfex/SURFEX/surface_cd.F90 surface_cd.F90].
The modifications for the stable case (Ri>0) are done here:
{{{
IF ( PRI(JJ) > 0.0 ) THENhttps://hirlam.org/portal/kpn/SBL_diag_201911_export/
	    ZFM = 1. + 10.*PRI(JJ) / SQRT( 1.+5.*PRI(JJ) )
	    ZFM = 1. / ZFM
}}}

The exchange coefficient for heat and moisture flux, Ch, is specified in subroutine [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/Harmonie/src/surfex/SURFEX/surface_aero_cond.F90 surface_aero_cond.F90].
The modifications for the stable case (Ri>0) are done here:
{{{
  ELSE
    ZDI(JJ) = SQRT(ZWORK3(JJ) + 5. * ZSTA(JJ) )
    PAC(JJ) = ZCDN(JJ)*ZVMOD(JJ)/(1.+15.*ZSTA(JJ)*ZDI(JJ)  &
             / ZWORK3(JJ) /ZVMOD(JJ) )*ZFH(JJ)    

}}}

For example, to change the Cm and Ch coefficients as in this [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1/Cm_Ch_in_43tg2_winter_N2M.png figure], where thick solid lines are default coefficients and thick dashed lines are modified ones, the subroutine code is modified as:

For Cm in [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/Harmonie/src/surfex/SURFEX/surface_cd.F90 surface_cd.F90]:
{{{
 IF ( PRI(JJ) > 0.0 ) THEN
!    ZFM = 1. + 10.*PRI(JJ) / SQRT( 1.+5.*PRI(JJ) )
    ZFM = 1. + 4.*PRI(JJ) / SQRT( 1.+7.8*PRI(JJ) )
}}}

For Ch in [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/Harmonie/src/surfex/SURFEX/surface_aero_cond.F90 surface_aero_cond.F90]:
{{{
  ELSE
    ZDI(JJ) = SQRT(ZWORK3(JJ) + 5. * ZSTA(JJ) )
!    PAC(JJ) = ZCDN(JJ)*ZVMOD(JJ)/(1.+15.*ZSTA(JJ)*ZDI(JJ)  &
!             / ZWORK3(JJ) /ZVMOD(JJ) )*ZFH(JJ)    
    PAC(JJ) = ZCDN(JJ)*ZVMOD(JJ)/(1.+3.*ZSTA(JJ)*ZDI(JJ)  &
             / ZWORK3(JJ) /ZVMOD(JJ) )*ZFH(JJ)
}}}

=== T2m diagnostics ===

A new near-surface diagnostic option (N2M=3) affecting T2m for the stable surface layer is available in cy43h develop branch. 
[https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/Diagnostics_development#AddinganewT2mdiagnosticformulationtoSURFEX See here for more information.]
N2M=3 gives slightly warmer T2m for Ri>0.

=== Snow roughness ===

Sander has concluded that the problematic T2m behavior (too cold) seems to be correlated with the presence of snow (Alps region in the KNMI domain).
Therefore, tests are ongoing with modified snow roughness.

The default snow roughness as specified in surfex_namelists.pm is:
{{{
 NAM_SURF_CSTS=>{
  XZ0SN        => '0.003',
  XZ0HSN        => '0.0003',
 },
}}}

== Results ==

=== Tests with different combinations of the planned settings are ongoing ===

 * [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201911/surface_ww_Maynooth_XRIMAX_191112.pdf Mariken presented her results so far at the Maynooth meeting in November.] The corresponding Monitor validations are available here:
   * [https://hirlam.org/portal/smhi/cy43h21_tests/nordRIV90mars2019_export/ nordRIV90mars2019_export]: First set of experiments including MEPS_prod
   * [https://hirlam.org/portal/smhi/cy43h21_tests/nordRImodAmars2019_export/ nordRImodAmars2019_export]: Some of the first set of experiments plus new ones with the latest version of cy43 and modified Ch and Cd.
 * Some experiment setups and links to validations by Patrick can be found under [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1#Modifiedtargetexperiments "Modified target experiments" on the "Validation for tagging Harmonie-43h2.1" wiki page ].
   * [https://hirlam.org/portal/smhi/cy43h21_tests/Test_surface_stable_N2M_export/ This Monitor validation includes tests with]:
     * Green: tg2_ref, original target 2 setup with XRIMAX=0 and N2M=2
     * Blue: As green but with XRIMAX=0.5, modified Ch shape and snow roughness XZ0SN=0.013, XZ0HSN=0.0013
     * Red: As blue but with N2M=3
     * The Ch-formulation used follows the red dashed line in this [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1/Ch_in_43tg2_winter_N2M.png figure]. The Cm-formulation used follows the black thick line.
     * So, the N2M=3 does give slightly warmer T2m as compared to N2M=2 but for this test/period the combination of XRIMAX and Ch setting still gives a too cold response. Okay, as we have concluded before, maybe we have okay T2m for "!MetCoOp/winter with XRIMAX=0 for the wrong reason. Without allowing a stable surface layer we should have a warm bias if physics is okay and no compensating errors are present…
   * Next test added a modified Cm formulation:
     * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1/Cm_Ch_in_43tg2_winter_N2M.png Now bot the Ch and Cm formulations follow the dashed lines in this figure].
     * [https://hirlam.org/portal/smhi/cy43h21_tests/Test_surface_stable_N2M3_CmCh_export/ The results are here].
     * With also modified Cm the T2m bias goes in even colder direction. The reason for this is probably that increased Cm decreases the U10m which tends to decrease the surface layer mixing and make it more stable (even if Ch does not change).
   * Next test is inspired by some SURFEX tunings used for the CERRA reanalysis project:
     * Eric Bazile explains in [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1/EBazile_GA2019_physics.pdf this presentation (slide 20, "V3" line)] that a few SURFEX tunings improve the CERRA results. These include snow heat capacity (Csmax), soil heat capacity (Cgmax), vegetation heat capacity for low (Cv_low) and high (Cv_high) vegetation. 
     * [https://hirlam.org/portal/smhi/cy43h21_tests/Test_surface_stable_CERRA_export/ The results are here].
     * The CERRA settings (magenta) leads in general to less cold bias than the former experiment (blue) but there are subregions where it goes in even colder direction... 
 * Kristian has made an experiment over Iceland for February 2016 where he uses tg2 as reference (using blending) and compare that with a combination of modified Ch [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1/Cm_Ch_in_43tg2_winter_N2M.png (red thick dashed line)] and N2M=3 (Dian2). A new scheme for turbulent fluxes in stable boundary layers made by Niels Woetmann Nielsen (2017) has also been tested (NWN4).
   * [https://hirlam.org/portal/kpn/SBL_diag_ISL_201602_export/ The Iceland 2016-02 results are here].
   * The combination in the "Dian2" experiment has big and good impact on T2m bias making is much less cold...
   * The Woetmann Nielsen "NWN4" experiment also gives an improvement in both the T2m bias and standard deviation.
   * Both experiments still have negative biases. An flawed experiment that set T2m equal to the lowest model level (approx. 12 m) temperature gave even better results. Negative cloud cover biases on several days in the experiments are the likely cause.
   * '''More test cases are needed! '''
   * In the NWN4 experiment (ecgate:~nhp/hm_home/cy43tg2_NWN_ISL4) the roughness length for heat (ZZ0H) varies as a function of the roughness length for momentum (PZ0): ZZ0H(:)=MIN(MAX(0.15-0.085*LOG(PZ0(:)),0.01)*PZ0(:),ZZ0HMAX). Here ZZ0HMAX is 0.4 m. ZZ0H goes to be closer to PZ0 when PZ0 is low.
   * Ri,max is set to 2.0 in the NWN4 experiment. It could properly be removed for this.
   * The Richardson number currently input to .../SURFEX/cls_tq.F90 is calculated from the virtual temperature. Would it be more correct to calculate this from the potential temperature for this purpose?
   * The Woetmann Nielsen theory should be tested for a thorough implementation, where USTAR, PLMO and U10m are all computed based on this.
   * ... it is not aimed at implementation in the upcoming release!
   * [https://hirlam.org/portal/kpn/SBL_diag_201911_export/ Further results for Denmark during 10 days in early November 2019].

=== Tests utilizing the Marsta observatory data  ===

 * The Meteorology department at Uppsala University has provided data from their [http://celsius.met.uu.se/?pageid=12&meny=7 open-land site Marsta] north of Uppsala. It includes 10 min data during 2018 for radiation fluxes, precipitation, temperature, humidity and wind at different levels in the 29 m tall mast and some soil temperature and humidity data.
 * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/XRIMAX_docu/BestDates4Testing.pdf Danijel has looked into a few periods during 2018 to identify good periods to investigate]. Danijel and Patrick decided to first study "Case I", March 26 - April 7.
 * A tg2 experiment with two members for !MetCoOp domain is running for this period; mbr000: tg2 reference, mbr001: as mbr000 but with XRIMAX=0.5.

'''Results using the mast data to force SURFEX offline'''

[[Image(Marsta_T2m_Feb-March.png, 30%)]] [[Image(Marsta_T2m_Sep-Oct.png, 30%)]]

 * This setup uses standard NWP settings, i.e. Force-restore + D95 snow and no special tuning.
 * The February-March period is snow covered while the September-October period is for a snow-free crop surface.
 * In conclusion, XRIMAX=0.2 gives in general the best performence. This indicates, Danijel and I would say, that the surface layer in SURFEX + Force-restore/D95snow in principle behaves well over snow and non-snow covered open-land surfaces. Why we have problems in the 3D setup is another story... 

=== NORD_2.5KM experiments with XRIMAX=0.5, modified calculations of drag and snow fractions March 2019  ===

 * [https://hirlam.org/portal/smhi/cy43h21_tests/nordRImodABmars2019a/ Preliminary results 1-15 March 2020]
 * [https://hirlam.org/portal/smhi/cy43h21_tests/nordRImodACmars2019_export/ Summary results 1-31 March 2020]
 * Status January 2020 [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/XRIMAX_docu/XRIMAXstatusJanuray2020.pdf here] and here:
 * Experiments with XRIMAX=0.5, but modified drag and snow fractions show potential to reduce the negative impact, but still improve the performance in stable situations
 * A next step will be experiments with reduced snow conductivity, to further reduce the rapid cooling of the surface in some situations ( with e.g. Csmax=5e-05, see  slide 11-16)

=== Additional tests by Samuel over AEMET domain  ===

[[Image(v_00000000_00000000_SpainPortugal_ALL_TT_0.1.2.png, 30%)]]


These tests include different combinations of the new diagnostic N2M=3 + XRIMAX=0.2 and modified Ch, Cm and CERRA settings. 
The tests were based in tg1, and run for around 10 winter days, using the initial first guess from the original tg1 experiment.

43tg1cca (reference tg1) vs:
- 1) 43tg1_N2M3_RI02 (XRIMAX=0.2)
- 2) 43tg1_N2M3_RI02_Ch (XRIMAX=0.2 + modified shape of Ch)
- 3) 43tg1_N2M3_RI02_ChCm (XRIMAX=0.2 + modified shape of Ch and Cm)
- 4) 43tg1_N2M3_CERRA (CERRA settings +XRIMAX=0.2 and modified Ch,Cm)
- 5) 43tg1_N2M3_CERRA_ext (CERRA settings + XRIMAX=0.2 + modified Ch,Cm, CSCOND=NP89, CV_crops=0.66E-5) 

Full verification results can be found here: 
[https://hirlam.org/portal/aemet/verif43tg1_tg2/N2M3_RI02_test/]


Comments for T2m (mainly from looking at the Dayvar T2m plots):
- XRIMAX=0.2 (experiment 1) reduces in general our positive bias in T2m during night; there's a better correspondence in minimum T2m with observations, but the cooling during early afternoon seems too fast. In plots of bias/stdv vs fc length, the bias is not improved except maybe in coastal areas.
- Then, adding the modified shape in Ch (or Ch+Cm) (exp 2-3), most of the change in T2m during the night is lost and the diurnal cycle behaves almost like in the tg1 reference (XRIMAX=0, N2M=2).
- The inclusion of CERRA's settings (exp 4) improve a little bit T2m over Spain with respect to the reference. It gives sligthly colder (warmer) nighttime (daytime) temperatures. The improvement is close to experiment 1, but the cooling is slower ( no degradation in early afternoon temperatures). In some subregions (Meseta Norte) the improvement is more important, affecting also to T2m during daytime. This increased T2m cycle can only be expected during wintertime and/or periods where the surface oscilates above & below 0ºC daily (thawing period), as found by Patrick through surfex offline runs in with the Marsta setup.
- The last set of settings tested (exp 5) doesn't have a strong impact in results, and it is not in the good direction.

Comments for U10m
- With XRIMAX=0.2 in U10m the wind bias increases 0.2-0.3 m/s during the evening & nighttime.  It is natural of course since Cm is lower than with XRIMAX=0 and therefore the momentum exchange is reduced. With the modified shape in Cm (experiments 3-4-5) this wind bias increase is partially reduced.

Comments for RH2m/Td2m

- Improvements in T2m come with a dryer atmosphere close to the surface which in general means a degradation in Td2m / RH2m, except in some subregions (MesetaNorte) where the reference was more wet than the observations.

Summary: 
From all the tests done, the experiment with CERRA settings seems to be a good compromise between improving T2m but not degrading too much U10m or Td/RH2m. Looking at the different sensitivity to the CERRA settings over the different subregions, it is suspected that the Cgmax tunning is more important than the Cv_low tunning (more sensitivity in regions with a larger fraction of non-vegetated soil over patches 1 + 2 ). With this in mind, some further tunnings could be tested such a larger decrease in Cgmax. The tested tunnings in z0 for low vegetation and/or orotur should also be included to alleviate the wind increase during nighttime introduced by XRIMAX>0.

CERRA settings mean:
 * Introduce a limit for snow heat capacity with Csmax=1.7E-5 (as Mariken points out this corresponds to a snow density of 500 kg/m3!)
 * Decrease Cgmax for bare soil from 2.0E-5 to 1.5E-5
 * Decrease Cvlow for low vegetation from 2.0E-5 to 1.5E-5

All these C-changes leads to increased heat capacity of the snow/soil/veg layer.

=== Tests by John de Vries over the KNMI domain for XRIXMAX and modified low vegetation roughness  ===

[https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/XRIMAX_docu/jdv.pdf The tests are summarized by John in this pdf.]

Comments by Patrick on the XRIMAX test in tg2:
 * Hmhm, yes more/too windy nighttime conditions is a degradation...
 * Why daytime T2m shows cooler conditions is not clear to me but since we should apply this to tg1, which is warmer, it is not too bad.
 * As expected, with reduced Rsmin increase, we get higher Q2m over open land areas. This is also good in a tg1 perspective.

Comments by Patrick on the increased z0 test in tg1:
 * Okay, good reduction in wind speed but still a bit too windy over open-land areas. Can an even further increase in roughness be motivated?

=== Discussions between Patrick and Eric Bazile and Yann Seity February 5-6  ===

 * Regarding tuning of Cs, Cg, Cv, and fraction of snow (and bare soil and vegetation): As shown in [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/XRIMAX_docu/XRIMAXstatusJanuray2020.pdf slide 6 by Mariken] the final CT used in the Ts equation is decided by a combination of these. In CERRA they chosed to tune Cs to solve their problems with cold T2m over snow but Eric agrees that tuning snow fraction is also a good candidate.
 * Yann says that they also suffer from a sever cold winter bias over snow in the mountain areas in AROME-France but they have not come up with a solution for this.
 * Eric claims that an orographic roughness parametersiation is always needed. They use CROUGH=Z01D in the AROME-France setup with 1.3 km resolution. So, he is not surprised we have U10m problems over Spain. Why it works over Scandinavia can be because we have enough forest (to tall?) to compensate for the lack of orographic roughness. Mariken, how does U10m look in AROME-Arctic over Svalbard?
 * In AROME-France they use snow roughness, XZ0SN=0.01. Eric claims that a higher roughness than the default one is needed outside Antarctica :-)
 * Eric would be interested to try some snow fraction formulations which include subgrid ororgraphy information. In regional climate RCA model, at SMHI, the snow fraction was lower the higher the subgrid orography was. Thus, more variability in snow cover in mountain areas. [https://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.89799!/Menu/general/extGroup/attachmentColHold/mainCol1/file/meteorologi_157.pdf See details in Section 2.7.1 in this report].
 * Eric is also interested to try new formulation of [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201911/z0_a_la_Raupach.pdf roughness length formulation a la Raupach (1994)].

'''Wim de Rooy reports (2019-11-28)'''
----------------
Some short remarks.
Peter Baas and I looked at the influence of Rimax against Cabauw tower observations for 1 year of data, analyzing output from an operational 3D run
and sensitivity experiments with different RIMAX in 1D, categorized for different times of the day.
In summary for temperature:
-increasing Rimax above 0.5 has almost no influence (apparently these very stable conditions almost never occur).
-the shape of the temperature profile near the surface improved with rimax > 0 (best shape with 0.2) but T2m decreases (so the negative bias increases)
From a physical point of view,  RIMAX>0 should be preferred of course (after solving the very negative biases above mountains with RIMAX>0).

About the clouds;
Sander mentioned a fog case in Cabauw where the cooling in the model seems to come from cloud top instead of the surface (according to observations)
This reminds me of something we regularly see in Harmonie: during daytime the global radiation can drop to almost zero (dark at the middle of the day in summer!?).
See the attached plot with harmonie global radiation in Cabauw against BSRN observations. With cloudnet data we hope to see if this is due to too high (liquid/ice) water amounts 
in the atmosphere or e.g. radiation scheme related. Anyhow, even for a complete overcast these values seems to be unrealistic low.

So could it be that fog/cloud layers are not transparent enough (for LW and SW) due to too high q_l/q_ice or radiation or ..?
BTW, before the update in the radiation by Kristian et al. we experienced the opposite, i.e. too transparent (warm) clouds but those days cloud fraction was too high.
------------------


'''Mariken comments (2019-11-28)'''
----------------
As a response to Sanders comments on 90 vertical levels, I would like to tell the ones of you that not were attending the surface working week in Maynooth in November, that I already have run some parallel experiments with XRIMAX=0/0.5 and VLEV=65/90, March 2019. The experiments show very clear that the degradation with XRIMAX=0.5 is much less with 90 vertical levels. These experiments were run with an early version of cy43. With a newer version of cy43 I have also tested modified calculations to reduce the effect of RI>0.  And, yes, it is possible to reduce the negative impact of XRIMAX> 0 in March, but still the forecasts become too cold... [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201911/surface_ww_Maynooth_XRIMAX_191112.pdf More details here]
------------------

'''Kristian comments (2019-11-28):'''
-------------------------------
This an important point, but we do see these issues in general - and not just in this one case. Cloud cover also does not give any quantitative information about the radiative forcing, e.g. if these are 5-6 octas of high cirrus clouds they should not matter much. As can be seen in this plot from van der Linden et al. (2019) the influence of surface temperature and the lowest model level on T2m, respectively, vary a lot over land in stable conditions:

[[Image(pastedImage.png, 30%)]]

Thus schemes that can diagnose the T2m temperature better in stable conditions are important!

'''Sander reports (2019-11-27):'''
---------------
At KNMI we are investigating what is happening in a fog case where the fog is formed in the night of 28/29 March this year.

Interestingly you can see a very large difference in behaviour of the shallow fog layer in HARMONIE and in the Cabauw tower observations. In the Cabauw tower the cooling of the atmosphere keeps happening from below (the surface is the active layer in long wave radiation, apparently the fog is too transparent for long wave radiation) when the fog is no deeper than 20 metres. In HARMONIE the model layer that becomes filled with fog is quickly cooling (even when the lowest model level is only 25 metres thick), causing the fog to become denser and colder than in reality. At some stage this cool air is mixed with the warmer air from above and then the next layer becomes foggy and starts to cool rapidly (a few degrees in one hour).

In reality the radiation fog layer starts to become the active cooling layer only when the fog layer is deeperhttps://hirlam.org/portal/kpn/SBL_diag_201911_export/ than 40-80 metres. So it looks like the radiation scheme is too sensitive in the long wave radiation for cloud water (and maybe also cloud ice), cooling the fog layer in the model too quickly. This may be one of the reasons for the too quick extension of the fog over the sea (where the surface fluxes are much smaller) and the too strong cooling of fog over the sea.

This long wave radiation effect may also be one of the reasons why some of the points in HARMONIE show such a very different behaviour with respect to the observed temperature over Scandinavia in very cold conditions? Maybe a shallow fog layer causes the too strong cooling of the lowest model level (to temperatures close to the radiation temperature of the atmosphere) at the points where there is a very significant underestimation of the temperature by the model? Maybe the cloud cover and vertical profiles (of the lowest few 100 metres) at the points with the largest deviations (positive and negative) can be investigated to find the reason for the very large difference between observed and forecasted temperatures?
---------------
