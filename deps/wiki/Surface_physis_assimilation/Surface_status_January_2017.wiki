== Strategic questions regarding surface data assimilation ==

During the autumn 2016 a few people started to discuss how to proceed with surface assimilation development considering that our NWP system now is more and more used in EPS mode and that we should incorporate more advanced surface processes (prognostic variables) and more satellite based products/radiances. During January 2017 the HIRLAM surface team was invited to a [http://hirlam.org/index.php/forum/surface-development/1249-surface-data-assimilation#1772 HIRLAM Forum discussion on this subject] which was followed by a Google Hangouts meeting January 26, 2017. [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/EKF_surface_work#StrategicquestionsregardingsurfacedataassimilationmeetingJanuary262017 Agenda and notes of that meeting can be found on this wiki].

'''Those people participating in the meeting discussed and reported how to proceed with work in near future so please refer to the memory notes for details.'''

== How to attack negative U10m wind bias as seen in verifications of cy40h1.2 development experiments ==

A discussion was active during December 2016 on how to attack the negative U10m wind bias as seen in verifications of cy40h1.2 development experiments. [http://hirlam.org/index.php/forum/surface-development/1257-near-surface-diagnostics This discussion can be found here under HIRLAM Forum]. One alternative Patrick Lisa had in mind was a possible tuning of HARATU but in discussion with Wim de Rooij et al. it turned out that this seem not to be a way forward to reduce the negative bias. During the discussion it was highlighted that the way we calculate U10m wind in SURFEX may not be representative for the observed U10m. Under certain weather circumstances a low lowest model level, i.e. model level 65 representing 12.5 m height, in combination with heterogeneous surface conditions (different tiles/patches with different roughness length present in the grid box) forces  unrealistically homogeneous values of wind, temperature and humidity close to the surface. This underestimate sub-grid horizontal gradients in the diagnostic quantities compared to observed conditions. A possible solution to this problem could be to use a higher model level as forcing for SURFEX, e.g. 62 or 63. But we need to be careful how that my affect numerical stability of the model since it involved coupling coefficients between atmosphere and SURFEX. Patrick is investigating this right now. Contacts will be made with colleagues at Météo-France as well to hear how they reason with respect to this "problem".

From earlier discussions and tests we know that surface roughness length as calculated by SURFEX based on ECOCLIMAP physiography may be questionable. Bolli has reported this for Iceland and he has also successfully improved U10m scores by modifying the roughness for natural grass areas. Mariken has noticed an annual cycle in U10m bias over the !MetCoOp domain with in general positive biases during winter conditions. This may be related to very low roughness length for snow covered surface during winter. But the vegetation based roughness may also be subject for tuning over the !MetCoOp domain. Mariken will look into this in sensitivity experiments.
 

This discussion on near-surface diagnostics has affected how we proceed with plans for development and release for cy40h1.2.

== FLake activities ==

Katya has successfully developed FLake in cy40h and short test simulations on the ECMWF machine looks promising. During the HIRLAM working week at DMI last December we had a FLake progress meeting where we concluded that FLake as part of a postponed cy40h1.2 release may look as a realistic option. If so, the suggestion was that FLake should be activated by default. Currently Katya and Patrick are preparing for two long validation experiments over the FMI and !MetCoOp domains respectively. One autumn and one spring simulation, respectively.

A revised version of a lake optimal interpolation paper has finally been submitted to Tellus, after two years of intensive work by 5 people.

== Glacier development ==

Emily is working on trying out glacier options in SURFEXv8 off line simulations. It is also on Ruth's agenda to become more active with SURFEXv8 this year. In connection to the upcoming SURFEX Users Workshop in Toulouse we will have a glacier development side meeting where HIRLAM and Météo-France colleagues will meet: [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/Glacier_plans]

== Sea ice development ==

Yurii and Bin met January 23 to discuss sea-ice development work. Please see [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/SURFEX-ice#Sea-icedevelopmentmeetingJanuary232017 summary and memory notes from the meeting on the sea-ice wiki page].

== T2m problems for weak wind and stable conditions  ==

In connection to the the November report [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/Surface_status_November_2016/hm_shflx_gm.pdf Nikolai Nawri (IMO) reported] problems with T2m problems for weak wind and stable conditions. Since then Nikolai says:
{{{
I have looked at Surfex codes to see if I could find anything were I could make sensible changes to improve
the T2m situation, but found nothing. Therefore, I will have to rely on more capable programmers to develop
a new turbulent heat flux scheme that also works well in inversion layers and with weak wind conditions. 
}}}
Patrick will discuss further with Nikolai on possible ways forward.

== Samuel Viana (AEMET) has joined the HIRLAM surface team as a new member  ==

Samuel introduces himself:
{{{
I did some research in PBL parameterizations a few years ago (I used mainly tower data, so no direct experience
in models from here). In the meantime, I have been working as an operational forecaster.

Javier Calvo has appointed me to work in surface modelling, so in the lasts months I've been trying to
gain some experience in the Harmonie system, running test experiments, compiling and running
SURFEX offline, etc, while also revising different sources (mainly Harmonie's wiki and SURFEX site) to
understand the present status and recent surface develoments in HIRLAM-C.

From HIRLAM's work plan document for 2017, we identified some tasks in WP SU3 where we think that I
could try to make some contribution. These tasks (testing and validating SURFEX options:
DIF, ES, MEB, BEM...). Among others, we are exploring the possibility to use data from a recent
network deployed in a mountain area in central Spain: [https://www.ucm.es/gumnet/instrumentation],
although this network isn't fully operative yet so it might take a while to get a decent dataset for validation.
