== Status with respect to Rolling Work Plan for Surface analysis and modelling ==

> '''Status notes are indicated like this.'''

> In general, many aspects of work with respect to the Rolling Work Plan for Surface were covered at the last [wiki:Meetings/Surface/Surface201705 Surface Workshop in Norrköping].

=== SU1: Introduce and assess more advanced data assimilation algorithms in SODA framework ===

 * Develop/assess EKF for soil and snow using SYNOP data in combination with the Force-restore soil and the new Explicit Snow (ES) scheme.
   * Priority: High. Staff: Mariken Homleid (1pm, !MetCoOp*), Karl-Ivar Ivarsson (1pm), Patrick Samuelsson (0.5pm, !MetCoOp*), Magnus Lindskog (IMPREX*), Trygve Aspelien (NVE Avalanche project*)
   > Mariken presented [http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/surfex/IMG/pdf/explicitsnowexperiments_mariken_170227.pdf tests with the Explicit Snow (ES) scheme] at the SURFEX Users Workshop in Toulouse. In conclusion, ES looks promising but must be combined with 2 patches to give reasonable results. Next step is to look into how variables of the Explicit snow scheme can be assimilated. 
   >
   > A problem with initial condition for ES in PREP has been solved.
   > 
   > [https://hirlam.org/portal/validation/40h1/OI_versus_EKF_13_16_May_export/ Monitor validation of first S(imple)EKF (versus OI) simulation looks promising]. Next step is to look into the reason for "crazy" Jacobian values which appear in some situations. This work will be coordinated with Magnus' IMPREX studies and Jelena's studies on STAEKF. 

 * Start assessment of MESCAN versus CANARI, and investigate sensitivity of anisotropic horizontal/vertical structure functions.
   * Priority: High. Staff: Mariken Homleid (0.5pm) 
   > Mariken has done some sensitivity tests with MESCAN. [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201705/SurfaceSpringMeetingSMHI_Mariken_170508.pdf See slides 44-47 in Mariken's presentation on MESCAN]. Next step is to use a summer period.
    * Further develop snow analysis and assimilation of snow in CANARI/MESCAN/SODA.
   * Priority: High. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (3pm, !MetCoOp*)
   > No activity yet.
   
 * Develop/assess EKF for sea ice, using satellite products in combination with the SICE scheme. 
   * Priority: Low. Staff: Bin Cheng (INTAROS*, TWASE*), Yurii Batrak (PhD work*)
   > No activity yet.

=== SU2: Introduce and assess new surface observations ===

 * Identify retrieval products (satellite/instrument) to use for each model variable ([wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/Satellite_list Satellite list]), with a main  focus on soil moisture, snow cover, snow water equivalent and sea ice cover. Implement product reading/processing in CANARI/MESCAN or in parallel and connect each product to a corresponding SURFEX variable in the SODA/EKF framework (see SU1):
   * Snow extent satellite products
	* Priority: High. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (1pm)
        > Katya and Patrick has visited a COST Action Workshop on Snow Data Assimilation, Offenbach, March 8-9. [https://agora.fmi.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21991738 Presentations at the Workshop are available here.]
   * Sea-ice extent and sea-ice drift products.
	* Priority: Low. Staff: Yurii Batrak (PhD work*), Bin Cheng (INTAROS*, TWASE*)
        > No activity yet.        

=== SU3: Explore and validate available SURFEX physics components: ===

 * Test and validate the behaviour of the full combination of DIF, ES and (MEB), with respect to the older soil and snow schemes, with focus on optimizing SURFEX options and parameter values. To start these experiments as soon as possible, use will be initially be made of Cy43 without data assimilation (i.e. in climate mode). Utilize a combination of offline SURFEX, MUSC, and the full 3D model depending on the type of study.
   * Priority: High. Staff: John de Vries (5pm), Samuel Viana (4pm), Nikolai Nawri (1pm, Icelandic external projects with snow focus ~4 pm*), Sigurdur Thorsteinsson (1pm), Trygve Aspelien (NVE Avalanche project*), Åsmund Bakketun (Master thesis at !MetNorway*)
   > [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/New_SURFEX_options_cy43h The wish list for new physics options in SURFEXv8] was completed at the Norrköping meeting with help from Patrick Le Moigne. Samuel has tried it out for a HARMONIE-AROME-climate domain centred over the Pyrenees including a sensitivity test for Horton surface runoff on/off. Further tests will be performed, possibly utilizing observed river discharge for validation.
   >
   > John presented progress and plans at the Norrköping meeting. Based on that and the discussion held a new wiki page dedicated to [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/Parameter_calibration_ISBA Parameter calibration of ISBA] has been created.

 * Activate lake model FLake (without data assimilation).
   * Priority: high. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (2pm)
   > [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201705/Norrkoping_FLake.pdf Katya presented most recent results on ongoing FLake experiments] at the Norrköping meeting. In conclusion, with FLake lakes behave more realistic than with WATFLX but more detailed analysis remain to be done after experiments finish.

=== SU4: Further develop SURFEX surface model components ===

 * Further improve aspects of SICE as e.g. snow on ice, prognostic ice thickness and ice drift functionality.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Yurii Batrak (PhD work*), Bin Cheng (0.5pm)
   > Yurii says: The latest developments in SICE is introduction of ice mass balance in a HIGHTSI-like way. First results were shown during ASM, and I would like to comment that parameterization for ice thickness evolution was tested in climate mode and it gave very promising results. But to obtain smooth ice field I had to run SICE for all ocean points and use ice fraction only for averaging and not to define ice-covered grid cells. I'm still haven't decided how to initialize new ice in NWP mode (in terms of ice thickness).

 * Implementation of FLake modifications/developments into SURFEX repository based on what is currently done in cy40h. Includes modifications of PGD physiography averaging methods.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (2pm)
   > No activity yet.
   
 * Develop a physically based glacier model for SURFEXv9.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Emily Gleeson (3pm), Bolli Palmason (1pm), Kristian Pagh Nielsen (0.5pm), Ruth Mottram (DMI, Greenland  ice-cap projects*)
   > Emily says: Been on extended leave for most of April and May. Will back to glaciers from mid June. So, no MUSC/SURFEXv8 working for glaciers yet. Kristian, Ruth and I are finishing off a paper on the glaciers for the EMS journal  Advances in Science and Research (ASR).
   >
   > Bolli is playing around wit the tree-layer ISBA-ES scheme. He sets the age of each layer as fresh snow in the first two and +10 years in the third. His idea is to use the age of the snow layers to calculate the albedo differently for very old snow (dirty ice). This should later work for 12 layers. I hope I'll have something to show you in autumn.

 * Evaluate the orographic/radiation implementation in Cy43 and apply further modifications/ developments.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Laura Rontu (1pm)
   > No activity yet. Occupied with atmospheric radiation work until September.
   
 * Evaluate and further modify/develop parameterization of orographic momentum fluxes.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Laura Rontu (1pm)
   > No activity yet. Occupied with atmospheric radiation work until September.
   
 * Modification of the SURFEX parameterization of fractional snow in complex terrain.
   * Priority: medium. Staff: Laura Rontu (0.5pm)
   > No activity yet. Occupied with atmospheric radiation work until September.
   

=== SU5: Assess and improve quality of surface characterization: ===

 * Document how MODIS LAI information should be processed to make validation possible for LAI fields over specific domains. Make a work plan for how to correct/adapt these fields where necessary, by either (i) modifying ECOCLIMAP physiography, (ii) implement diagnostic LAI and/or (iii) use STAEKF for updating LAI field locally.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Bolli Palmason (1pm), Jelena Bojarova (UERRA*)
   > Bolli: The LAI documentation is on my long todo list, hope I'll get it done soon.
   > 
   > [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201705/Slide_from_Jelena_19042017.pdf Presentation by Jelena] on how STAEKF has been introduced in cy40h for LAI modifications. The implementation works technically. Next step, as mentioned above, is investigation of "crazy" Jacobian values. 
   
 * Evaluate/develop TEB specific parameters.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Ekaterina Kurzeneva (1pm)
   > Katya will look into the assimilation of the third layer street temperature. Do we need that? Maybe better to run TEB in peaceful coexistence...
   
 * Coordinate efforts to critically evaluate currently used physiography and gather modifications for updated releases via the SURFEX team at Météo-France.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Patrick Samuelsson (coordination)
   > At the Norrköping meeting needed modifications of garden fractions for towns over the Netherlands were discussed. KNMI will proceed with necessary actions. Patrick Le Moigne welcome input for an updated ECOCLIMAP-II version.
   
 * Follow the Météo-France efforts in the ESA-CCI land cover map process and coordinate with relevant HIRLAM staff.
   * Priority: high. Staff: Patrick Samuelsson (coordination)
   > A status report on [http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/surfex/IMG/pdf/presentation_ecosg_2102.pdf ECOCLIMAP - second Generation by Stephanie Faroux] was given at the SURFEX Users Workshop.

== Discussion points ==

 * Currently we lack competence in CANARI which hinder us to perform tests/development. E.g. replacing first guess based on grid-averaged values (from atmospheric files) with land-averaged values (from SURFEX files). Katya has the ambition to become more knowledgeable in CANARI in a while… but currently...
 * Next few months there will be a focus on EKF/Jacobians understanding by !Magnus/Jelena/Patrick/Åsmund/... EKF results will be high up on the agenda at the Ljubljana meeting.
 * Yurii would like to start entering SICE into the SURFEX repository in June. Thus, [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/SURFEX_after_cy43t the SURFEX development strategy will be tested]... Still open question how the rest of ALADIN/LACE may join.
 *  A potential post-cy40h1.2 as an intermediate step towards cy43/44h was discussed at the surface Workshop. In addition to target 2 it may include FLake, MESCAN, EKF in combination with Force-restore and maybe D95 snow replaced by Explicit Snow Scheme, CANARI - SURFEX coupling to go beyond grid-averaged first guess.
 * A quick fix for urban fractions in ECOCLIMAP2.2 for the domain over the Netherlands is needed. Any progress at KNMI after the Norrköping meeting?
 * Trygve has setup a [https://github.com/metno/offline-surfex-forcing GitHub project for new SURFEX offline forcing generation based on python] where John and Trygve join in further development. Non-HIRLAM colleagues will be welcomed when the !GitHub code is more organised... 
 * Parameter sensitivity studies by John de Vries: [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/Parameter_calibration_ISBA A wiki page dedicated to Parameter calibration of ISBA] has been set up. Discussions are ongoing on choice of parameters and data to calibrate against.
 * Problems reported by duty forecasters and also related to validation of cy40h1.2:
   * The warm bias related to extreme cold winter temperatures may reduced by the use of 2 patches and utilizing the open-land T2m instead of grid-averaged T2m. This may also help reported problem with too small daily amplitude in T2m. Yet to be examined.
   * If 2 patches do not help to solve the problem with low amplitude in T2m, maybe a too high heat capacity for vegetation (PCV) as has been reported by Eric Bazile (Météo-France) as an issue for Arpege can be worth looking into.... [http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/aladin/IMG/pdf/expose_ebazile_asm2016_wg_surfex.pdf See slide no 8 in presentation by Eric Bazile here.]
 * STAEKF has been introduced by Jelena into a development version of cy40h for LAI modifications. Works technically.
 * Work is in progress to deal with negative U10m bias in cy40h1.2 for the Nordic area: Lower tree height gives lower roughness and higher wind.

== Plans of meetings ==

  * Surface autumn meeting will be co-arranged with the LACE Data Assimilation Working Days (DAWD) which will take place in Ljubljana September 18-20.
