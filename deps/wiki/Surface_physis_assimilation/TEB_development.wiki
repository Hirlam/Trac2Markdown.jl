== Background ==

Currently in cy40h1.1 TEB is running with following settings:
 * All town characteristic parameters are based on default ECOCLIMAP parameter values.
 * {{{LTEB_CANOPY=.FALSE.}}}, which means that the surface boundary multi layer scheme over town is not activated and T2m, Rh2m, U10m in TEB are represented by their canyon values.
 * {{{LGARDEN=.FALSE.}}}, which means that any vegetation in towns according to ECOCLIMAP is moved to the nature tile and towns do not include any vegetation.
 * One TEB prognostic variable is assimilated, XT_ROAD(:3), i.e. ground temperature at third level in the streets.

== Discussed ideas on modifications/development of TEB  ==

 * Currently snow is treated the same way in TEB as over nature, i.e. there is no removal of snow from the streets (and accumulation of snow at snow-storage places) in the model as it is in reality. Please see more discussion regarding this issue [wiki:TEB_development#SnowinTEB below].
 * Should we assimilate TEB variables at all? Currently, in the operational model, we modify XT_ROAD(:3), i.e. ground temperature at third level in the streets, based on increments in T2m (these increments are horizontally interpolated by CANARI from our SYNOP network). I wonder if it is not better to leave TEB alone than to assimilate some non-representative(?) T2m SYNOP value...?
 * All town characteristic parameters are based on default ECOCLIMAP parameter values which may not be relevant for towns in all HARMONIE domains. Within the Copernicus UrbanSIS project tests have been done to use modified land-use information. See [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/HirlamMeetings/HMG_visit_SMHI_September_2016/UrbanSIS_HMGmeeting_SMHI_080916.pdf this presentation] for more information where it is shown that e.g. better/finer physiography could have positive impact. But improving this is quite some work!
 * Test {{{LTEB_CANOPY=.TRUE.}}}? But if yes, the surface assimilation needs development as CANARI does not work with this option now.
 * Now we run TEB as a concrete desert without any vegetation inside the town (no gardens or vegetation along the streets). LGARDEN option can be tested and validated...
 * Patrick met Valery Masson at Météo-France a few months ago and understood from him that TEB is really undergoing some serious development, e.g. related to Building-Energy Model, irrigation of gardens in town, solar panels on roofs, module of comfort indices in town, ventilation in buildings. Some of this potential is available in cy43/SURFEXv8 and it could be good for us to understand how this potential can be beneficial for NWP. Maybe not necessarily in the operational model itself but as an offline post-processing tool where more town-important weather aspects can be extracted....?

=== Snow in TEB ===

'''Idea by Carl Fortelius:'''

I see the point with snow removal. If the locations, where the snow is dumped, are known, as they are in the Helsinki region, and if one is prepared to ignore the delay between snow fall and snow removal (big ?), then one could even think about applying a masking function on the snow fall, collecting all (or part) of the snow that would have fallen into selected grid cells, into specified receptor cells instead. Don't know if that's a good idea, though. At least roofs would have to receive separate treatment from roads, I guess.

'''Comment by Alexander Mahura'''

By introducing the masking function, it will be good to keep in mind that even if there is snow fallen in the urban grid-cell  there is real possibility  that if the amount is small (assume ? value) than the removal will not take place at all in such cells. So, may be the masking needs to include also a threshold/ critical value on snow amount (in order to activate or not activate "removal" of snow from a particular cell to the receptor cell)

It might be assumed that not all snow is completely removed to the dumping locations, and partially (which ? % to assume) it will remain on both sides of the roads (until the melting period in spring). For example, in Russian cities such walls on both sides of the roads can be 1+ meter. Such situations are possible and seen in Canadian, Alaska's (USA), north Norwegian cities as well.
Then during spring these will give additional large load of melted snow and water on the roads' surfaces for a period of several days/weeks. The spatial distribution of drainage network will be essential to include as it will take/ "consume" the melted water.

The relocation of  snow from urban cells  to specific receptor cell will take some time  (up to several hours, depending on size of grid-cells). So, may be include some function with a liner dependence on proportional reducing amount of snow with time in these cells with a time passing by from the moment starting snow "cleaning" activities by road service authorities/companies. Guessing, that delay time depends on road authorities programmes (& ranges from the immediate actions to ). Simply, each big city has own designed schedule on where (e.g. urban cells) to start and when to start.

URBAN GROUP DISCUSSION:
Patrick Samuelsson (SMHI),  
Patrick Le Moigne (Météo-France),  Alexander Mahura (DMI), Rosmarie de Wit (ZAMG),  Rafiq Hamdi (RMI)

Application of TEB urban for : Climate and NWP
Climate studies: try to use so-called urban “finger-print” (based on fx. LUCY model output – spatio-temporal variability of “urban” related fluxes); can be used for climate adaptation studies for large urban areas at finer scales (down to 1? km) with using already calculated meteorology from CORDEX data
Numerical Weather Prediction:

  1) Importance of urban areas representation in the ECOCLIMAP-I, -II; there is underestimation of urban areas presence most probably due to cities’ growth & using outdated datasets fx.: Corine 2006 vs 2012); possibility of improvement using national high resolution databases; discussed ex. for Denmark (Copenhagen MA); Enlarging (tuning) representation of urban areas by increasing fraction values for cells having smaller percentage; for urban areas fractions: expecting improved info from ECOCLIMAP-SG dataset (2018) with about 300 m resolution. 

  2) Sub-grid representation of urban areas: Consider characteristics for urban classes (from ECOCLIMAP) vs. urban districts assigning (city center, high (medium) building districts, industrial commercial, residential, rural) using (statistically accumulating) from typical values fx. Nordic vs. other EU countries; or ex. of local climate zones (related to temperature regimes)

  3) !Precip/Snow in Nordic cities: consider summer – precipitation removed through drainage network and the rest is evaporated; spring (melting snow period) – 1-2 weeks when excessive amount of water are still not evaporated; discussed also impact of snow removal from Nordic / northern cities.

Extra info: communication between the involved persons/teams
1) involve also Patrick Samuelsson (SMHI),  
2) info-summary to Patrick Le Moigne (Météo-France),  
Propose possible contributions (area in focus, tasks with priorities, ) from teams involved is expected.
