[wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/First_cy43h_setup Many surface aspects related to the short term development for cy43h2.1 release are presented on this wiki.]

> '''Status notes are indicated like this.'''

=== SU1: Algorithms for surface assimilation ===

 * '''SU1.1 Develop/assess SEKF for soil, snow and vegetation using SYNOP data in combination with the diffusion soil and the Explicit Snow (ES) schemes in SURFEXv8.1'''
   * '''SU1.1.1 Activate, develop and evaluate SEKF for diffusion soil scheme as implemented in SURFEX/SODA. (Åsmund, Ekaterina, Magnus, Jelena, Patrick, Mariken, Trygve, Sigurdur)''' 
   * '''SU1.1.2 Activate, develop and evaluate SEKF for explicit snow scheme as implemented in SURFEX/SODA. (Ekaterina, Magnus, Jelena, Patrick, Mariken, Trygve, Sigurdur, Åsmund)'''
   * '''SU1.1.3 Combine the development in SU1.1.1-1.1.2 and set up a pre-operational system based on (S)EKF for soil, snow and vegetation. (Ekaterina, Magnus, Jelena, Patrick, Mariken, Trygve, Sigurdur, Åsmund)'''
   > [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DWSlcCpYTH7zIhqgaIW4j14Y1s8__v6a-9YGK3HbPKs/edit?ts=5d661dec#slide=id.p Åsmund reports status and progress in this presentation]. Here cy43h with new surface physics is used in combination with SEKF for soil moisture and TITAN/gridPP is used for the screen-level observations analysis. This setup also includes modified snow SWE assimilation by Trygve and Mariken. The whole setup is available via Åsmund's git fork: https://git.hirlam.org/users/asmundb/Harmonie.
 * '''SU1.2 For CANARI in HARMONIE-AROME, (i) solve inconsistencies in land/sea mask between SURFEX and climate files (ii) implement new weigted T2m, Rh2m, and snow for first guess (based e.g. on patch info) (iii) exclude need of climatological snow density. Activate the MESCAN part of CANARI, and investigate sensitivity of anisotropic horizontal/vertical structure functions. (Ekaterina, Mariken)'''
 * '''SU1.3 Further develop snow analysis and assimilation of snow extent in CANARI/MESCAN/SODA. Developments on snow analysis in CANARI for AROME-France. (Ekaterina, Mariken, Laura)'''
   > Laura: no progress. 
 * '''SU1.4 Develop/assess EKF for sea ice, using satellite products in combination with the SICE scheme. (Yurii, Ekaterina)'''
 * '''SU1.7 Test and further develop the surface analysis tool based on gripp and TITAN in combination with SODA. This is an alternative to CANARI. (Trygve, Åsmund)'''
   > See SU1.1.3.
 * '''SU1.8 Continue earlier externally financed work on EnKF and assimilation of raw radiances (e.g. soil moisture, temperature and snow (smos)). Also investigate/develop needed forward models like CMEM/HUT work with SSMIS, AMSR2 and MWRI and Sentinel 1 SAR data. Investigate/design methodology for a consistent generation of upper air and surface perturbations. Address problem of sampling of a long term memory error. Enhance EnKF methodology to be suitable for a multy-patches approach. In the long term this will lead towards consistent surface and upper-air surface perturbations. (Tomas, Jelena, Ekaterina)'''

=== SU2: Use of observations in surface assimilation ===

 * '''SU2.1 Examine/compare available satellite snow-extent (and possibly Snow-Water Equivalent products) to identify their pros and cons. Some might become available through ODB. (Ekaterina, Mariken, Magnus, Susanna, Bolli)'''
  > As part of the IMPREX project Susanna will visit ECMWF in September to compare their way of modelling and assimilation (current 1-layer and new multi-layer) of snow with our (Trygve's) offline experimental setups where we test the e.g. the 3-L snow scheme.
 * '''SU2.2 Examine available satellite soil moisture products for use in surface data assimilation. The description of the sub-tasks contains the following information: [soil moisture product] - [assimilation method] - [SURFEX version].'''

   * '''SU2.7.2 [H-SAF] - [sEKF] - [8.1] (Ekaterina, Mariken)'''

=== SU3: SURFEX: validation of existing options for NWP ===

 * '''SU3.1 Test and validate the behaviour of individual components, as well as the full combination, of DIF, ES, MEB in cy43/SURFEXv8.1. Utilize a combination of offline SURFEX, MUSC, and the full 3D model depending on the type of study. Also, utilize climate-mode simulations (without data assimilation) to identify and reduce biases.
   * '''SU3.1.1 In climate mode, over different domains, examine biases in cy43 when the full combination of DIF, ES, MEB are activated in combination with recommended namelist settings. (Samuel, Patrick, Mariken, Ekakterina, NiNa?, Emily, John, Trygve)'''
    > The [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/New_SURFEX_options_cy43h full wish list] is now under testing. Samuel has updated the [wiki:HarmonieClimate/HCLIM43 HARMONIE Climate cy43 wiki page] with latest status and setup information. For example a new climate branch, based on [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1 target 1], named CY43HCLIMh2.1.target.1 is available for testing HCLIM43.
   * '''SU3.1.2 By namelist modifications, parameter tuning and/or code modifications try to reduce any biases identified in SU3.1.1. (Samuel, Patrick, Mariken, Ekaterina, NiNa, Emily, John, Trygve, Patrick LM, Aaron)'''
   * '''SU3.1.3 Based on the outcome of SU3.1.2, repeat the simulations for different domains as done in SU3.1.1 and evaluate the performance. This version of HARMONIE-AROME will be used for coupling to surface data assimilation in SU1. (Samuel, Patrick, Mariken, Ekaterina, NiNa, Bolli, Emily, John, Trygve)'''
 * '''SU3.2 Develop methods for parameter optimization in SURFEX (ISBA) and apply the method on an operational cycle to reach better performance. (John)'''

== Other aspects ==

 * Quite some efforts have been spent to understand aspects of the stable surface layer, i.e. what happens when the Richardson number is allowed to be positive (XRIMAX>0). A combination of solutions/development may be needed involving for example modified exchange coefficients for stable surface layer, modified T2m diagnostics formulation (Patrick has a SURFEX offline setup with [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Surface_physis_assimilation/Surface_status_September_2019/dian_screeninter_pragueApr2016.pdf modified Kullmann solution]), modified roughness length (especially for snow), ...
