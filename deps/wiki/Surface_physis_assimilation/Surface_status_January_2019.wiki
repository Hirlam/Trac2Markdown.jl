=== SU1: Algorithms for surface assimilation ===

 * '''SU1.1 Develop/assess SEKF for soil, snow and vegetation using SYNOP data in combination with the diffusion soil and the Explicit Snow (ES) schemes in SURFEXv8.1'''
   * '''SU1.1.1 Activate, develop and evaluate SEKF for diffusion soil scheme as implemented in SURFEX/SODA. (Åsmund, Ekaterina, Magnus, Jelena, Patrick, Mariken, Trygve, Sigurdur)'''
     > Trygve and Åsmund report SODA development in cy43h:
     >
     > Namelist options for all tiles to disable/enable parts of the assimilation
     > 
     > Generalization of the input to make the format handling and nature only reading transparent
     >
     > Gathering and distribution of assimilation increments which works both from CANARI (HPROGRAM=AROME) or from Soda (we have started to run also offline runs (+PGD/PREP) on multiple processors and see some positive impacts but also some things that does not work. NetCDF writing is terribly slow and FA output does not work on more than 1 processor offline (yet))) 
     >
     > an offline open source tool to make screen level analysis (gridPP) as observational input to soil assimilation (instead of CANARI which is a part of the NWP code)
     > 
     > Some local changes in the configuration/Make part to include/link support software based on an input file
     >
     > An offline environment inside the inline AROME source code repository using the same source code and scripts for inline AROME runs and offline SURFEX runs
   * '''SU1.1.2 Activate, develop and evaluate SEKF for explicit snow scheme as implemented in SURFEX/SODA. (Ekaterina, Magnus, Jelena, Patrick, Mariken, Trygve, Sigurdur, Åsmund)'''
     > Trygve is working on assimilation of snow depth/SWE for the 12-layer snow scheme in cy43h. No activities yet on assimilation of other prognostic snow variables (e.g. temperature, density, ).
   * '''SU1.1.3 Combine the development in SU1.1.1-1.1.2 and set up a pre-operational system based on (S)EKF for soil, snow and vegetation. (Ekaterina, Magnus, Jelena, Patrick, Mariken, Trygve, Sigurdur, Åsmund)'''
 * '''SU1.2 For CANARI in HARMONIE-AROME, (i) solve inconsistencies in land/sea mask between SURFEX and climate files (ii) implement new weigted T2m, Rh2m, and snow for first guess (based e.g. on patch info) (iii) exclude need of climatological snow density. Activate the MESCAN part of CANARI, and investigate sensitivity of anisotropic horizontal/vertical structure functions. (Ekaterina, Mariken)'''
     > Katya reports: Work to harmonize CANARI and SURFEX physiography started. First, CANARI physiography files (mXX) were studied from the technical side (origin, content, file formats, etc.). It was found that they contain both the fractional land cover and the land-sea mask, but CANARI uses only the land-sea mask. Second, the CANARI land fraction was compared to the SURFEX land fraction. It was found, that they differ everywhere, but mainly in the North of Finland and over Åland islands (for the MetCoOp domain). Moreover, the observational operator in CANARI contains a gag, so that wights for the pure sea background values around land observation reports (SYNOPs) and pure land background values around sea observation reports (SHIPSs) are not modified according to the land-sea mask. This causes a threat for the quality of the analysis, mainly for snow. First step to reduce the pressure from this problem could be using of the land fraction field (in addition to the land-sea mask) from the mXX files.    
 * '''SU1.3 Further develop snow analysis and assimilation of snow extent in CANARI/MESCAN/SODA. Developments on snow analysis in CANARI for AROME-France. (Ekaterina, Mariken, Laura)'''
     > Katya reports: Technically, the experiment with the assimilation of SE data from H-SAF is running. But the results are not analyzed yet. This work will be done, also overlapping with CARRA project. Laura agreed to join this work.
 * '''SU1.4 Develop/assess EKF for sea ice, using satellite products in combination with the SICE scheme. (Yurii, Ekaterina)'''
  > Yurii says: I've a prototype implementation of SICE-EKF (for a snow-free case for now) that I'm going to test with some off-line simulations. I've started right from cy43 to not spend time for code adaptation later and to have a possibility to play with gridPP for 2d OI.
 * '''SU1.7 Test and further develop the surface analysis tool based on gripp and TITAN in combination with SODA. This is an alternative to CANARI. (Trygve, Åsmund)'''
  > Trygve reports: TITAN-gridPP is now used in all tests with new surface physics and EKF in cy43h. TITAN-gridPP does what CANARI does but more, with respect to our default setup of CANARI. CANARI includes options, for example with respect to quality control, which are not yet in TITAN but on the other hand we have never tested these options in CANARI. Regarding the technical setup:
   >
   > TITAN (quality control): Netatmo SCT test takes time (2-5 min) but can partly be run outside the time-critical loop. Also, non-!MetNorway setups will not use Netatmo now. Uses Python scripts which reads bufr files with ecCodes. Seems to do what is expected.
   >
   > gridPP (surface analysis): Uses less than 1 minute per parameter for the !MetCoOp domain (runs in parallel with use of OpenMP).
   >
   > SODA (assimilation): Can be run in parallel with the use of the offline setup. With one core it still works okay for OI but is quite heavy for EKF.
 * '''SU1.8 Continue earlier externally financed work on EnKF and assimilation of raw radiances (e.g. soil moisture, temperature and snow (smos)). Also investigate/develop needed forward models like CMEM/HUT work with SSMIS, AMSR2 and MWRI and Sentinel 1 SAR data. Investigate/design methodology for a consistent generation of upper air and surface perturbations. Address problem of sampling of a long term memory error. Enhance EnKF methodology to be suitable for a multy-patches approach. In the long term this will lead towards consistent surface and upper-air surface perturbations. (Tomas, Jelena, Ekaterina)'''
  > Tomas will continue this work during 2019 financed by external resources. Jelena will work on this within her HIRLAM core contribution. 

=== SU2: Use of observations in surface assimilation ===

 * '''SU2.1 Examine/compare available satellite snow-extent (and possibly Snow-Water Equivalent products) to identify their pros and cons. Some might become available through ODB. (Ekaterina, Mariken, Magnus, Susanna, Bolli)'''
  > Susanna is comparing snow observations (SWE and snow density) provided by ECMWF with corresponding HARMONIE-AROME analysis. SWE compares well while snow density in ECMWF data has much higher variability than HARMONIE-AROME snow density. We need to understand what the ECMWF snow density actually represent...
 * '''SU2.2 Examine available satellite soil moisture products for use in surface data assimilation. The description of the sub-tasks contains the following information: [soil moisture product] - [assimilation method] - [SURFEX version].'''
   * '''SU2.2.1 [ASCAT, AMSR-2, ...] - [EnKF] - [8.1] (Tomas, John)'''
   * '''SU2.2.2 [ASCAT, AMSR-2, SAR-C (Sentinel-1), ...] - [ EKF ] - [ 8.1 ] (Magnus, Tomas)'''
 * '''SU2.3 Examine available satellite sea-ice extent products and make them available in ODB. E.g. OSI SAF. (Yurii, Bin)'''
 * '''SU2.4 Explore the possibility to use SIMBA buoys for assimilation of sea-ice conditions. (Bin, Yurii)'''
 * '''SU2.6 Examine the use of amateur weather observations (like Netatmo) in surface assimlation, using gridpp (instead of CANARI). (Trygve, Joris)'''
  > See comments under SU1.7.
 * '''SU2.7 Examine available snow products for use in surface data assimilation. The description of the sub-tasks contains the following information: [soil moisture product] - [assimilation method] - [SURFEX version].'''
   * '''SU2.7.1 [Cryoland] - [sEKF] - [first 7.2, later on 8.1] (Magnus)'''
    > Magnus is currently working on assimilation of Cryoland satellite snow extent in HARMONIE for an external project. Same principles as developed by Mariken is used.
   * '''SU2.7.2 [H-SAF] - [sEKF] - [8.1] (Ekaterina, Mariken)'''

=== SU3: SURFEX: validation of existing options for NWP ===

 * '''SU3.1 Test and validate the behaviour of individual components, as well as the full combination, of DIF, ES, MEB in cy43/SURFEXv8.1. Utilize a combination of offline SURFEX, MUSC, and the full 3D model depending on the type of study. Also, utilize climate-mode simulations (without data assimilation) to identify and reduce biases.
   * '''SU3.1.1 In climate mode, over different domains, examine biases in cy43 when the full combination of DIF, ES, MEB are activated in combination with recommended namelist settings. (Samuel, Patrick, Mariken, Ekakterina, NiNa?, Emily, John, Trygve)'''
    > Samuel: Finished all the needed modifications to the CY43 git branch to run new sfc options in climate mode. A suspected memory leak when using LSELECT was reported to the systems group. More details & instructions about how to setup a CY43 climate run can be found here [[https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieClimate/HCLIM43]].  First multi-year simulation (10/2013-10/2017) has been run for IBERIAxxm_2.5 using new sfc options & ERA5 BCs. Now starting to look at results, first studying the soil spinup and then validating against satellite/reanalysis data.
    >
    > Emily says: I have some 9 month runs with climate version of cy43h where the 3 snow layers were used so I will run another with 12 and some of the other surface updates. Plan to compare results against ERA5 (radiation,...).
   * '''SU3.1.2 By namelist modifications, parameter tuning and/or code modifications try to reduce any biases identified in SU3.1.1. (Samuel, Patrick, Mariken, Ekaterina, NiNa, Emily, John, Trygve, Patrick LM, Aaron)'''
    > Process of analysing first long simulations has started...
   * '''SU3.1.3 Based on the outcome of SU3.1.2, repeat the simulations for different domains as done in SU3.1.1 and evaluate the performance. This version of HARMONIE-AROME will be used for coupling to surface data assimilation in SU1. (Samuel, Patrick, Mariken, Ekaterina, NiNa, Bolli, Emily, John, Trygve)'''
 * '''SU3.2 Develop methods for parameter optimization in SURFEX (ISBA) and apply the method on an operational cycle to reach better performance. (John)'''
 * '''SU3.3 Examine the potential use of, until now, non-utilized options in TEB. (Carl?)'''
 * '''SU3.7 Test new ECUME formulations for the sea tile in cy43h. (Samuel, Karl-Ivar, Bolli)'''

=== SU4: SURFEX: development of model components ===

 * '''SU4.1 Develop a physically based glacier model for SURFEX based on the Explicit Snow Scheme. Includes glacier albedo aspects. (Bolli, Kristian)'''
  > Some good ideas for ISBA-ES where discussed in e-mail between us and Aaron Boon last year, but since it was decided to use the D95 for the CARRA project all new work was halted. We've develop a new method of reading in satellite albedo into the system to use over glacier areas. 
 * '''SU4.2 Further development of SICE (effect of melt pond, snow-ice formation, improvement of albedo scheme) (Yurii, Bin, Ekaterina)'''
 * '''SU4.3 Evaluate the orographic radiation (ORORAD) implementation in cy43 and apply further modifications and developments. (Laura)'''
 * '''SU4.4 Implement, evaluate and further modify/develop a new orographic roughness parametrization (OROTUR). (Laura)'''
  > Laura is doing some OROTUR experiments with cy43h...
 * '''SU4.5 Further development of MEB which can include separate soil column under snow/non-snow, snow albedo in forest, effect of intercepted snow on albedo. (Patrick, Aaron)'''

=== SU5: Assess/improve quality of surface characterization ===

 * '''SU5.1 ECOCLIMAP activities. ECOCLIMAP cover map, corrections and studying the impact. Corrections mainly for Iceland, Greenland, Svalbard. Examining for Croatia and Spain.  Studying of urban areas. (Bolli, Ekaterina, Patrick, Mariken, Samuel, Teresa, Kristian)'''
  > Bolli: New ECOCLIMAP-II map done for Greenland with improvements for coastline, glacier extents, lakes. LAI and Albedo come from MODIS products. New map uses new cover numbers for Iceland and Greenland and therefore should soon be usable by all.
 * '''SU5.2 Soil maps activities. HWSD and Soilgrids corrections and studying impact. Corrections will be done mainly for Denmark, Iceland, Greenland, Svalbard, Scandinavia. Examining for Iberia. (Bolli, Kristian, Ekaterina, Patrick, Mariken, Teresa, Samuel)'''
  > Patrick: The new Soilgrids clay/sand data set suggested by Laura et al. is now implemented and made available as an option in cy43h. It is suggested to become our default soil data base for cy43h.
  >  
  > Bolli: New HWSD maps ready overwritten with Soilgrids data.
 * '''SU5.3 Tree height data activities. Tree height data upgraids and studying the impact. The work is planned for 2020, after upgrades of the database for Norway. (Mariken, Teresa, Patrick)'''
 * '''SU5.4 Lake database (GLDB). Participate in GLDB developments and studying the impact. (Ekaterina, Bolli, Laura, Patrick)'''
  > Bolli: New lake maps for Iceland still to be delivered to Margarit and Ekaterina. New lake covers for Greenland should be included in new GLDB.
 * '''SU5.5 ECOCLIMAP SG activities. Examining and and participate in developments if possible. (Teresa, Samuel, John, Ekaterina)'''
  > John has compiled an ambitious and comprehensive report on "A First Evaluation of the Evolution towards ECOCLIMAP-SG". An updated version is on its way which will be circulated to all surface people as soon it becomes available. ECOCLIMAP-SG looks interesting and attractive in many aspects but the changes are also quite big which may influence the weather/climate in a non-trivial way... sensitivity studies are needed.
  >
  > Bolli: First look at SG over Iceland show way to high tree coverage. Coastline errors over North Greenland.


=== SU6: Coupling with sea surface/ocean ===
