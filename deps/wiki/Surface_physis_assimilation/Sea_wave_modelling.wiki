== Background ==

The long term HIRLAM strategy says: One obvious way to further extend the model towards a more complete earth system model is by making the interaction between atmosphere and sea more realistic through coupling of the atmosphere with an ocean or sea surface model. A good starting point would be to couple the model to a model representing the sea surface, like the wave model WAM, rather than to a more involved (and computationally expensive) 3D ocean model. The WAM model is well known in the HIRLAM services. Preliminary studies of coupling the HARMONIE-AROME configuration with WAM have indicated possible benefits for the description of surface drag and winds over sea. This work should be followed up with more extensive studies, discussions with the SURFEX community, and considerations of how best to treat the coupling with the sea surface in the ALADIN-HIRLAM NWP system. At a later stage, coupling with a multi-layer ocean model can be considered. 

A draft version of the ALADIN-HIRLAM-LACE Rolling Work Plan (RWP) for 2018, WP SU6, Coupling with sea surface/ocean, includes these tasks: Code and Technical documentation of coupling process, Construct cycling with OASIS coupler in cy38, Replace POM with NEMO in ALADIN/SI system, Evaluation of coupled system ALADIN/NEMO, Implementation of ocean wave model, Set-up of coupled system ALADIN/NEMO/WAM.

Activities in different teams related to modelling of sea waves:

=== The Slovenian team ===

People involved: Matjaž Ličer (matjaz.licer at nib.si), Peter Smerkol (peter.smerkol at nib.si), Anja Fettich (anja.fettich at nib.si), Benedikt Strajnar (benedikt.strajnar at gov.si), Neva Pristov (neva.pristov at rzs-hm.si), Jure Cedilnik (jure.cedilnik at gov.si)

Jure Cedilnik [http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/aladin/IMG/pdf/pomadin_2way_coupling.pdf presented the work by the Slovenian team] at the [http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/aladin/spip.php?article287&lang=en Joint 26th ALADIN Workshop & HIRLAM All Staff Meeting 2016]. Currently they are replacing POM with NEMO in their coupled atmosphere-ocean modelling system for the Adriatic Sea. WAM has been tested as well, coupled via the coupler OASIS. Their experience is that WAM was very expensive but it may be due to the use of a non-optimized version of WAM(?). During 2018 Peter Smerkol will document the coupled system (including WAM). The plan is to return to wave-coupling once NEMO is running okay over the Adriatic but it is not at the top of their list for now. The team will gladly share their experience in wave-coupling and provide code which can show how they have been doing it.

=== The Norwegian team ===

People involved: Malte Müller (maltem at met.no), Jakob Kristoffer Süld, Adil Rasheed, Jørn Kristiansen, Øyvind Sætra, Ana Carrasco, Trond Kvamsdal

At a HIRLAM meeting in September 2017 Malte Müller gave a [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Meetings/Member_institute_visits/HMG_visit_METNorway_September_2017/Malte.pdf presentation on Plans for Atmosphere- Ocean- Sea- ice Coupling at METNorway]. In his presentation he refers to a paper by [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.447 Süld et al. (2015)] where they explain the coupling of HARMONIE-AROME configuration with the ocean wave model WAM, applied over a Scandinavia domain.

Malte says: The computational efficiency is good (and possibly better than external coupling). There is a problem with the orientation of the grid. WAM works well on a lat/lon grid, but it needs corrections in the numerics when it is rotated grid. This induces errors. However, there are numerical corrections for this, but I am not sure about status in WAM on that matter. The other option is external coupling. With the inline coupling, the grid size and grid resolution needs to match with the one of AROME. There is no interpolation process in the coupling.

=== The French team ===

People: Cindy Lebeaupin Brossier (cindy.lebeaupin-brossier at meteo.fr)


Cindy Lebeaupin Brossier gave a [http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/surfex/IMG/pdf/lebeaupin_suw2017.pdf presentation about a French team collaboration] on "Coupling NEMO to AROME via the SURFEX-OASIS interface: Development and application to the HyMeX SOPs in the Western Mediterranean region" at the [http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/surfex/spip.php?article426 SURFEX Users Workshop, Toulouse, 2017]. This work is now documented and is currently under review in a paper by [https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2017-91 Voldoire et al. (2017)].


=== The Swedish team ===

People: Lichuan Wu (lichuan.wu at smhi.se), Patrick Samuelsson (patrick.samuelsson at smhi.se)

Lichuan Wu started a new 2-year position at SMHI on September 25th. Lichuan has a background in wave current and wave-atmosphere coupling. The following works have been tested in previous work:

(1) Atmosphere-wave coupling (WRF-WAM and WRF-WW3). 

* roughness length from wave to atmospheric model (coupling model)
* new drag coefficient parameterization and turbulence closure scheme under swell conditions (still working on) 

(2) Wave-current coupling (WAM-NEMO3.7). The following wave-current processes have been implemented into the NEMO3.7.

* sea-state-dependent momentum flux 
* sea-state-dependent energy flux
* Stokes-Coriolis forcing 
* Stokes drift impact on tracer advection

Within HIRLAM Lichuan will work on an operational implementation of a sea wave model into the ALADIN-HIRLAM NWP system.


=== The German team ===

The german team under the leader of Joanna Staneva in HZG (Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht Centre for Materials and Coastal Research) has tested several wave-current interaction processes. However, they have not set up the online coupling model. They use NEMO model to read the output data from WAM model to test the wave impact on the upper-ocean mixing. For the wave-atmosphere interaction, the wave model provides the roughness length to their atmospheric model. 

== Comments on how to proceed ==

Some thoughts and question marks (currently by Patrick) on how we may proceed. But please keep in mind that they are very ignorant due to my limited knowledge in wave modelling.

 * SURFEX is the current/future surface model in the ALADIN-HIRLAM NWP system so it seems natural that a wave-model "talks" to the NWP system via the SURFEX via using OASIS3-MCT as described by the French team.
 * But, the question has been raised: Should the coupling be done via a coupler or not (i.e. direct subroutine call)? Most people seems to argue that coupling via a coupler is definitely preferred. But does a coupler come with additional computational cost that may be significant in an operational NWP system?
 * Which wave model is most relevant for our NWP system? Does it depend on model domain, e.g. which sea/ocean area are included, like shallow/deep sea/ocean or more or less complicated land/sea contrasts (complicated coast and/or islands)?
 * Should even more than one wave model be considered in an operational setup depending on the answer above?
 * ....
