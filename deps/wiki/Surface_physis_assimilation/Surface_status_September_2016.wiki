== Glacier progress ==

As described on the [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/Glacier_plans glacier wiki page] we have a short term pragmatic
development plan for cy401.2 and a longer term development plan for SURFEX8/cy43...

The short term plan is to limit the glacier surface temperature to maximum 0degC. SURFEX Code modifications by Emily Gleeson is now tested by Kristian Pagh Nielsen:

{{{
I have set up an experiment on ecgate (.../ms/dk/nhp/hm_home/IGA_exp1 (& .../GLB_exp1)) to test Emily's glacier surface update in Ha. cy40h1.1.
It compiled well, but there where some minor problems with PGD that still need to be solved. (IGA is an abbreviation for the Greenland+Iceland domain).

The outstanding checkpoints are: 

   1) Does the update work also in coming operational setup (IGA cy40h1.1)
   2) Do we get reasonable values for the sensible and latent heat fluxes, when the glacier surface is exposed.
}}}

Emily expects to have time for glacier development after September 16.

Bolli Palmason says:
{{{
I have some tests on my todo list since we have to come up with something for the new IGA domain (Greenland+Iceland).
I would like to test a combination of my initial setup - that copies some of the LGLACIER things in SURFEX - with the Emily fixes.
}}}

Ruth Motram says:
{{{
1) I have discussed the new IGA test run Kristian mentioned with colleagues and I will do some experiments with our
current glaciers model offline forced with this when the output is ready. This is also of interest to some of our
collaborators at the University of Iceland who may well be getting in touch with Bolli (if they have not already done so)
soon with regard to the Iceland reanalysis!

2)I will meet with Marie Dumont and Laura Rontu at FMI around the snow albedo workshop. I would like to discuss in a
little more technical detail both the SURFEX set-up that we want to implement in HCLIM and the glaciers issues in Harmonie
right now. I still plan to start working on this, probably in the second week, in September as previously discussed.

== Sea-ice progress ==

The sea-ice plans made up in Norway in April according to the [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/SURFEX-ice sea-ice wiki] are still valid.

Yurii is working in the harmonie-40h1_ISBASFX8 branch which is in sync with harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1
[wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/DIF_versus_Force_restore (see details here)]

Yurii Batrak says
{{{
I've ran some very short-term experiments with harmonie-40h1_ISBASFX8 in nwp mode. But that was experiments over
small Svalbard domain. So, no 3DVAR, only blending (I can try to run a few cycles with assimilation).
I would say that technically it runs without any problems but I have not checked output for other tiles except SEA.
Currently I'm working on update of SICE code to get rid of temporary GRIB files that are created during Canari stage.
}}}

Bin Chen says
{{{
In June, there was a workshop in AWI about sea ice mass balance buoy (IMB), data inter-comparisons. One goal was to utilize
IMB to monitor sea ice thickness in the Arctic Ocean in a sustainable way. The buoy people also talked about maximize
to utilize IMB data for other application, e,g, not all IMB data were incorporated into the GTS (not everyone in
the meeting were familiar with GTS), I mentioned that the IMB data can be utilized for NWP model data assimilation,
although some people see IMB data are more useful for remote sensing application. By the way, there are currently
200 SIMBA were deployed and most of them were in Arctic Ocean. Some of them are of course die-down, but there is
a trend to have more SIMBA available for the Arctic.
}}}
Bin would be happy to work together with Yurii whenever we see the need for some process transfer HIGHTSI -> SICE.

== Physiography progress ==

The physiography plans made up in Norway in April according to the [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/pgd_ecoclimap_work physiography wiki] are still valid.

A status update by Bolli Palmason:
{{{
First version of updated ECOCLIMAP for Greenland is ready and Xiaohua has already been testing it for IGA domain.
This version includes a lot of updates for Iceland. First verifications show improvements in some key parameters.

My PGD todo list:

1. Deliver the updated ECOCLIMAP to Katya to fix the lake database for Iceland.

2. Make comparison of MODIS LAI and ECOCLIMAP LAI for Greenland and test effects on wind speeds.

3. Create documentation on the HIRLAM wiki for others to create MODIS LAI maps for comparison with ECOCLIMAP database.
I was asked to do this during the Surface working week.
}}}


== Progress in LAI/transpiration work ==

Sander Tijm and Nadia Bloemendaal at KNMI have been running experiments with modified LAI to control model deficiencies via transpiration. Their
work is described in this [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/LAI_modifs_for_evaporation LAI/transpiration wiki].

Bolli Palmason indicates that when his task number 3 in the "PGD todo list" above is finalised it can be helpful in the work on modified LAI...

Patrick plans to apply some LAI modifications on the 2-patches experiments over the !MetCoOp domain for May 2016 to see if it can help to further
decrease the bias in Rh2m over northern Scandinavia.

== Progress with 2 patches ==

There are a few 2-patches experiments done and planned for cy401.2 development purposes. See [wiki:Harmonie_40h1/40h1.2_validation validation of HARMONIE-40h1.2]
for results. The results so far look promising with an improvement especially in Rh2m over Scandinavia during the spring. See wiki on
[wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/Two_patches_development development of the use of two patches in SURFEX for cy40h]
for more details.

== Progress surface EKF development ==

Not much concrete HIRLAM progress has been made here since the Norway April meeting where notes are found at the
[wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/EKF_surface_work surface EKF wiki].

However, Magnus Lindskog is working on surface EKF methods in the context of the IMPREX EU project where they
are applied in HARMONIE/SODA for the force-restore case. Our longer term development includes EnKF-methods.
At the SMHI visit by HMG September 8 Magnus will present both EKF and EnKF progress within IMPREX.

In August Åsmund Bakketun will start a Master thesis project at !MetNorway dedicated to EKF methods in SURFEXv8 applied
on the diffusion soil scheme. The plan now is to get Åsmund going with SURFEXv8 and connect him with the European
EKF/SURFEX team later during the autumn.

Patrick has created a SODA development branch in the SURFEX repository here:

http://svn.cnrm-game-meteo.fr/projets/surfex/branches/SODA_V8

It is planned to be announced together with a SODA wiki/Forum which is temporarily created here at Météo-France:

https://opensource.cnrm-game-meteo.fr/projects/surfex/boards

However, there are still some technical issues with the SODA wiki/Forum which need to be solved (e.g.
a Forum addition is distributed to the whole SURFEX community and not only to the SODA community). 
Clément Albergel is working on solving this together with Météo-France IT experts.

== Progress with snow analysis and assimilation ==

Laura Rontu says:
{{{
Please find interesting materials of the COST HARMOSNOW albedo workshop at
}}}
http://www.harmosnow.eu/index.php?page=24%20-%2025.08.2016,%20Helsinki 
{{{
After a while they have promised pdfs of the presentations in addition to the recordings which are available already now.

Next we need to think how to prepare to the COST HARMOSNOW WG3 on data assimilation workshop in March,
not to lose the opportunity to do coordinated snow assimilation work with the COST colleagues from
DWD and elsewhere. Preliminary suggested dates are in connection with COSMO workshop, 8th-10th March 2017, Offenbach, Germany.

Here at FMI we will arrange a local seminar soon to discuss the results of Maxime's summer work,
i.e. what follows from the comparison between HARMONIE, SYNOP snow depth, MetOp and MSG SE and globsnow SWE
to our future snow assimilation. There is raw report by Maxime at
}}}
http://hirlam.fmi.fi/tmp/MaximeFMI.pdf but you can well wait a few weeks to get a summary and suggestions based on it.

Development related to snow assimilation will not enter the model before cy43h.
