'''This page is intended for communication of status, development and documentation of HARMONIE Climate (HCLIM).'''

== Background ==

At the [wiki:Training/HarmonieSystemTraining2015 HARMONIE-Climate training course in Norrköping, September 2015], it was decided to arrange the HCLIM wiki as
separated parts for cy38 and cy40. Soon a more organised management of HCLIM development will be announced. In addition to the HCLIM cycles a more
general development of HARMONIE related to technical improvements was discussed at the meeting. Following that discussion a separate wiki page is
dedicated for suggestions and discussions on technical improvements.

As a developer of HCLIM please actively use the HCLIM wiki to update the status of ongoing development. List issues that we need to consider and
list your name on issues you are involved in. 

== HCLIM development branches ==

Development of HARMONIE as climate model is dedicated to cycles. Cycle HCLIM38 is currently the default cycle, while future development will focus on HCLIM43.

== Handling HCLIM output ==

 * HARMONIE output is in the FA format. On the [wiki:HarmonieClimate/HCLIM_output HCLIM output] page some info can be found how to convert these file to GRIB or NetCDF, and how to deal with rotated winds.
 * RCAT is a analysis package developed by SMHI in python. It's available on [https://github.com/jplind79/rcat Github].
