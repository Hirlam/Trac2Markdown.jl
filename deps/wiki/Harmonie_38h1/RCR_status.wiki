=== DMI ===
 
 * Operational timelines and revisions with RCR-38h1 at DMI
    * 22 June 2015: An upgrade on RCR-38h1.2 (dka38h12) with main focus to reduce over prediction of cloud cover for Danish area.
      * 30 May 2015: Parallel pre-operational suite dka38h12b with 25h forecast. 
        * main components: use of edkf option instead of edmfm, which showed main sensitivity on cloud cover during three month-long test of Aug 2014, Jan  2015 and March 2015; activation of Danish surface t2m and RH2m observation from road network; activation of ATMS data. The update also include a tuning of deep soil temperature response to surface increment, which is an temporal measure as outcome of the diagnosis/discussion at the ASW 2015 about the observed problem with hot soil and snow melting in the runs at FMI/MetCoOp for northern Scandinavia during March 2015. 
    * 10 March 2015: An upgrade of RCR-38h1 to that of 38h1.2 (dka38h12), with main effect on reduction of winter time T2m bias for Danish area

=== Checkpoint for each RCR centre ===

 Based on the settings in harmonie-38h1.beta.3 each RCR is expected to report remaining problems in general and with respect to 37h1.2 in particular. Please report back on the bullets below about the things know at the moment and with a time estimate where the answer is not yet known.
 
 * Technical stability
  * Computational efficiency.
  * Robustness of the settings for operational-mode.
  * Ensure regular monitoring data and web interface using existing tools., 
   * How/when can we use the new monitoring interface?
  * Post-processing data streams. 

 * Meteorological performance.
   To establish as clear as possible an assessment about the status of the performance (advantages and deficiencies) and to describe them in the RCR page or the links pointed to;
  * Behavior in main parameters of T2m, W10m, Cloud cover, humidity and MSLP, including those local characteristics and diurnal pattern.
  * Behavior in significant weather (strong precipitation, storms, fog, cold winter days, hot summer days...)
   * To get an idea about [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/Harmonie_38h1/ValidationTests#Resultsmonitoringforsensitivityandvalidationrunsusing38h1 sensitivities] for some selected settings, such as
     * ECOCLIMAP 1 or 2
