Tasks discussed/worked on/solved. 
This report can be used as input for Helsinki meso-scale working week.

Participants: Sami Niemela, Ulf Andrae

== '''Status''' ==

SMHI is running CY31t0 with :

 * ALADIN Scandinavia 10km, 60 levels, 00,12 UTC+48
 * AROME South Sweden 2.5km, 60 levels, 00 UTC+24
 * AROME North Sweden 2.5km, 60 levels, 00 UTC+24

FMI is running CY30t1 with :

 * ALADIN Scandinavia 11km, 40 levels, 00,12 UTC+24
 * AROME South Finland 2.5km, 40 levels, 00,12 UTC+24

== '''Unification of scripts''' ==

So far the ALADIN/AROME reference scripts created by Ulf have only been
reference in a sense that they have been available to everyone. They
haven't been widely used, at least not to our knowledge. Work was done
to modify the scripts to fit under FMI's SMS system and eventually also
under HIRLAM mSMS. Sami will continue the work and Ulf will later test
the scripts at ECMWF ( with or without mSMS ) and update them at hirlam.org


== '''Coupling''' ==

There is strong need to be able to couple AROME directly to HIRLAM. This
is not possible today since the SURFEX part of AROME cannot handle
HIRLAM data. Instead of modifying SURFEX we took the simple approach and
used gl for conversion of ECMWF/HIRLAM files to an ALADIN file. This
file was then fed to fullpos which creates inital/boundary data for
ALADIN-NH/AROME. We were able to run a forecast but the quality of the approach 
has not yet been evaluated. Since cycle 31t1 both ALADIN and AROME distinguish between water and ice
cloud condensate. The possibility to add ice and water condensate to the
initial/boundary condition was introduced. If ice cloud condensate is
asked (HIRLAM/ECMWF --> AROME), it is diagnosed in gl from the total
condensate and the temperature using the probability function from HIRLAM.

== '''AROME quality''' ==

The quality of AROME was discussed and we both felt that the quality of
the surface parameters is not satisfying. This is not resolution
dependent since experiments with ALADIN-NH at 2.5km gave similar results
as HIRLAM. Recently it was found that the lfi files, i.e. the surfex files, 
were decode in the wrong way. After a correct decoding and interpolation
the scores are now comparable with the scores from HIRLAM and ALADIN.

At SMHI there are still computer related problems with
spurious cold temperatures. The influence of data representativeness
issues (obseravtion stations on small islands) will be further studied
by looking the land and sea areas separately.

The quality of the precipitation forecast seems to be promising, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. It seems that AROME is able to create
meso-scale convective systems with realistically looking wind and
precipitation structures. However, there is an indication that with
current implementation, the AROME is overdeveloping the convective
activity (i.e. too intense precipitation).

== '''Verification''' ==

The 11-km ALADIN at FMI ( CY30t1 ) underestimates the cloud cover. This
is however not seen at SMHI for the same cycle. Comparison of the
namelists revealed nothing. One lesson to learn (again) is that it is
important to compare results regularly. It was suggested already in
Copenhagen last spring that we should collect the vfld-files for ALADIN
10 km from each institute ( FMI/SMHI/DMI) and compare them on the same
plot. If FMI and DMI put their daily vfld files ( with stations as
defined in gl_extract/scr/ewglam.list ) at hirlam.org Ulf will take care
of the verification and the display. Perhaps the verification can be run at hirlam.org in the future?


== '''Repository''' ==

It is felt that it would be beneficial if the AAA cycles were included
in subversion. It would be would be easier to handle local changes and
gather corrections to be sent to Meteo France. The code also becomes a
more natural part of the HIRLAM distribution. The functionality of the
code browser is another strong argument for putting the code in to
subversion. The scripts and gl should preferably also be put under
revision control. Ulf have with help from Tomas W tested to merge CY31t0
+  local changes + CY31t1 without any problems.
