== '''DMI''' ==

DMI is running '''CY29t2''' with :

 * '''ALADIN''' Scandinavia 11km, 40 levels. Once a day, 00 UTC ''+24h''
 * '''ALADIN-H/NH''' Denmark 2.5km, 40 levels, ''with HIRLAM physics''. Once a day, 00 UTC ''+24h''
 * '''ALADIN-H/NH''' Denmark 2.5km, 40 levels, ''with MF physics''. Once a day, 00 UTC ''+24h''

Nesting :

 * HIRLAM (15km) --> ALADIN (11km) --> ALADIN (2.5km) 

DMI will soon replace the above cycle with a new one, '''CY31t1''':

 * '''ALADIN''' Scandinavia 11km, 40 levels. Once a day, 00 UTC ''+24h''
 * '''ALADIN-NH''' Denmark 2.5km, 40 levels, ''with HIRLAM physics''. Once a day, 00 UTC ''+24h''
 * '''AROME''' Denmark 2.5km, 40 levels. Once a day, 00 UTC ''+24h''

== '''SMHI''' ==

SMHI is running '''CY31t0''' with :

 *  '''ALADIN''' Scandinavia 10km, 60 levels. Twice a day, 00,12 UTC ''+48h''
 *  '''AROME''' South Sweden 2.5km, 60 levels.  Once a day, 00 UTC ''+24h''
 *  '''AROME''' North Sweden 2.5km, 60 levels.  Once a day, 00 UTC ''+24h''

Nesting :

 * HIRLAM (22km) --> ALADIN (10km) --> AROME (2.5km) 

Problems :

 * In AROME there is sometimes spurious cold temperatures. The problem seems to be computer related, because it is not seen on HPCE at ECMWF

Tests of '''CY31t1''' also on HPCE at ECMWF :

 * '''ALADIN''' Scandinavia 10km, 40 levels, with ECMWF boundaries  
 * '''ALADIN''' Scandinavia 10km, 91 levels, with ECMWF boundaries  
 * '''ALADIN''' Scandinavia 10km, 40 levels, with HIRLAM - RCR boundaries  
 * '''AROME'''  North Scandinavia 2.5km, 60 levels, with ALADIN boundaries  

Problems :

 * Running ALADIN with ECMWF on the boundaries needs more evaluation

'''HIRLAM'''/'''ALADIN'''/'''AROME'''/'''UM''' verification against ''SYNOP'' and ''TEMP'' stations is available online at
https://hirlam.org/portal/smhi/WebgraF/
 
== '''FMI''' ==

FMI is running '''CY32h2''' with :

 * '''AROME''' South Finland 2.5km, 40 levels. Twice a day, 00,12 UTC ''+24h'' 

Nesting :

 * HIRLAM (7.5km) --> AROME (2.5km) 

Problems :

 * Too strong precipitation for deep convection.
 * Too strong outflow from the convective systems.
 * T2m too cold.

'''HIRLAM'''/'''AROME''' verification against ''SYNOP'', ''TEMP'' and ''Helsinki testbed'' stations is available online at http://fminwp.fmi.fi/WebgraF/


== '''KNMI''' ==

KNMI is running '''CY31h1''' with

 * '''AROME''' Netherlands (300x300), 40 levels. Once a day, 00 ''+24h''
 * Wall clock time 1h50m, forecast 1h35m on 64 processors (more in convective weather)
 * Initialized from interpolated 11 km HIRLAM analysis (3D-VAR)

Nesting :

 * HIRLAM - H11(11km) --> AROME (2.5km) 

Problems :

 * Clouds/showers develop too late over the sea, especially with dry middle troposphere
 * Too strong precipitation for deep convection, too many spreading anvils
 * Too strong outflow out of showers (temperature of outflow seems OK)
 * Not enough weak precipitation over larger areas with Mesoscale convective systems
 * Too weak winds near the surface over land?
 * Small cold spots during the night (nesting problem of AROME in HIRLAM?)

== '''INM''' ==

INM has been experimenting '''CY29t2''' on HPCE with :

 * '''ALADIN''' with ''HIRLAM physics''.

INM is also on the way in building daily runs over Spanish domain. '''CY31t1''' 
will be built on INM's Cray X1E platform:

 * '''ALADIN''' Spain 11km, 40 levels.
 * '''ALADIN-NH''' Spain 2.5km, 40 levels. 

== '''MF''' ==

MF is running '''CY31t2''' with

 * '''AROME''' South-west of France 2.5km (240x240), 41 levels. Once a day, 00 ''+30h''
 * Initialized from interpolated ALADIN analysis (3D-VAR). No meso-scale DA yet.

Problems :

 * AROME is too cold and dry during night-time. Day-time is OK.
 * Coupling problems: convergence in boundary region --> spurious rain amounts.
 * AROME is not always able to present weak precipitation amounts (about 0-4 mm/12h) well. 

Near furure:

 * Moving to NEC platform --> Area enlarged to cover whole France.
 * CY32t1
   * Hail included.
   * Microphysics enhancements for low clouds (fog).
   * New cloud scheme + EDKF for shallow convection.
