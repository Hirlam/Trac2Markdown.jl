''(released on March 9 2006)''

== Highlights of 7.0 beta1 ==
 * Script changes of revision control system from CVS to Subversion
 * A number of code and script modifications of technical nature
   * change of format for surface observation analysis statistics file obsa
   * modification to enable running larger problemsizes & more PEs
   * modification to allow use of higher horizontal resolution ECMWF boundary data
   * add compilation of finlake.x and lnps.x
   * change default for SMSTRIES from 2 to 1 to skip automatic resubmission of jobs
   * updated tangent linear/adjoint code identity-test facility
   * corrections related to control of lateral boundaries in 4DVAR
   * corrections that enable running of 4DVAR with LSMIX=yes and for various domains, use of statistical structure function
   * correction that allows specifying forecast length for synoptic time by a new parameter LLMAIN which can be specified on the command line

No meteorological impact is expected to be associated with this release, relative to the previous beta release, 6.4.4, for the reference configuration.

According to a decision taken by the HIRLAM Management Group meeting in Feb 2006 (MGM 2), a new release numbering scheme is hereby introduced for the HIRLAM releases. The present release number, 7.0beta1, refers to the fact that it is the first feature release with Subversion for the intended official release 7.0. A more detailed description about the new ReleaseNumbering convention is available.

Using the naming convention applied in the previous HIRLAM projects, this release is equivalent to 6.4.5.

That this release is a beta implies that the script has not been thoroughly tested. It is anticipated that within a short time the first release candidate for HIRLAM 7.0, 7.0rc1, will be issued.

== Meteorological impact ==

None, comparing to the previous beta release 6.4.4, for the default (reference) configurations.


== Description of the changes ==

The main changes implemented in this release are related to the transition from the CVS repository to the Subversion repository. To minimize the task of transition, the change in the revision control system affects only a few top-most scripts. Average users should not feel this change.
 * '''change in the top-level "Hirlam" script''' which allows users to use Subversion repository for versions after 6.4.4, and cvs-repository for versions between 6.4.1 to 6.4.4. For versions prior to 6.4.1, the earlier procedure of running experiment should be followed.
 * '''change in format for surface observation analysis statistics file obsa'''. The change enhances portability of the result file.
 * '''larger problemsize & more PEs'''. The largest tested problem size now is the INM-ONR domain with double horizontal resolution and 60 levels.
 * '''higher horizontal resolution ECMWF boundary data'''. With the modified Env_ecmwf, the maximum resolution ECMWF data with 0.25° and 91 levels has been tested on the ECMWF-HPCD platform. Horizontal resolution for surface quantities is now the same as for upper air.
 * '''compilation of finlake.x and lnps.x'''. This is to enable nested experiments.
 * '''automatic re-submission''' after a crash disabled. This is especially desirable for running code tests with large problem sizes. Automatic re-submission can be turned on by change SMSTRIES from 1 (default) to larger numbers.
 * '''TL/AD ID test facility'''. The tangent linear/adjoint code identity-test facility is now updated.
 * '''control of lateral boundaries'''. Bug corrections for LBC under 4DVAR.
 * '''4DVAR option''': Corrections that enable running of 4DVAR with LSMIX=yes and for various domains, use of a statistical structure function.
 * '''specifying forecast length for synoptic hour'''. Correction that allows for specifying a forecast length for the synoptic time through a new parameter LLMAIN which can be specified at command line.

See CodeUpdate


== Code test and validation, known problems, bug reports, todos ==

Code test with limitied assimilation cycles has been performed on the ECMWF platform. Since this release is a technical one, no specially designed data assimilation tests at cycling mode has been planned. See details in [wiki:TestEvaluation7.0 TestEvaluation7.0].
