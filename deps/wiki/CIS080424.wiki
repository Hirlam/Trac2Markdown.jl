== What is '''cis080424''' ==

'''cis080424''' is a snapshot of the Hirlam code branch CIS dated on April 24, 2008. '''CIS''' refers to the Comprehensive Impact Study of new observation data types in the HIRLAM-A programme, with source code based on current versions of the synoptic scale HIRLAM system. cis080424 is fully compatible with the recently tagged version of [wiki:Hirlam_7.2 Hirlam_7.2] rc3, with following special features
 * experimental scripts and code extension for assimilation of AMSU-B, AMSU-A over ice and land, Seawinds, Geostationary and Polar-orbit AMV winds;
 * remote sensing observation data for two episodes, covering Feb 1-28 2007 and July 24-Aug 24 2006
   * The CIS data are available on ECMWF platform at EC:/hirlam/cis/obs/$obstype with $obstypes={amsub; amv; ascat; gbgps; mhs; modis; osisaf; sws; vadvvp}
 * no LSMIX is used per default

== '''cis080424''' source code downloads ==

 * '''cis080424''' can be browsed online via [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/tags/cis080424 HIRLAM wiki page]
 *  '''cis080424''' can be obtained via Subversion command, e.g.,
{{{
   svn export https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/cis080424                      
}}}
 * On ECMWF, a checkout version of the cis080424 is available on ecgate as
{{{
   ecgate:/home/ms/dk/nhz/hirlam_release/cis080424
}}}
 * The export tarball of the Hirlam cis080424 is available on ECMWF:ecgate as `/scratch/ms/dk/nhz/cis080424.tar.gz`, or on ECFS: `ec:/hirlam/src/tar/cis080424.tar.gz`

=== Running cis080424 on the ECMWF platform ===
Users can take a look at the example setup on ECMWF/ecgate: ~nhz/hl_home/cisconv in which an experiment setup for winter episode to use only conventional data can be found.

On ecgate, you may follow steps below to set up a CIS experiment, say CISSWS
 * Create experiment set-up
{{{
  mkdir ~/hl_home/CISSWS; cd ~/hl_home/CISSWS
  ~nhz/Hirlam setup -r cis080424              
}}}
 * Review and modify scripts. e.g., Most of the CIS-specific data impact study may be configured via changes to a few scripts
{{{
  ~nhz/Hirlam co scripts/Env_expdesc                  # main configuration file
  ~nhz/Hirlam co scripts/Env_input                    # use existing boundary and climate data from parallel experiments
}}}
 * The main switches for CIS settings can be found in Env_expdesc, e.g, important variables and default values are listed below
{{{

 * A local change can be made to allow use of boundary and climate data from parallel experiments
   * edit scripts/Env_input to modify, for winter episode
{{{
  BDEXP=cis0201; BDDIR=ectmp:/nhz/hirlam/$BDEXP   # boundary files
  CLEXP=cis0201; CLDIR=ectmp:/nhz/hirlam/$CLEXP   # climate files
}}}
   * and edit, for winter case, scripts/Env_expdesc to change BDSTRATEGY from operational into bc to use 4 times/day BC data.
   * for summer period,
{{{
  BDEXP=cis0201; BDDIR=ectmp:/nhe/hirlam/$BDEXP   # boundary files
  CLEXP=cis0201; CLDIR=ectmp:/nhe/hirlam/$CLEXP   # climate files
}}}
   * and edit, for summer case, scripts/Env_expdesc to change BDSTRATEGY back to operational to use 2 times/day EC forecast data.
   * Note: Please do not use ob- files from parallel experiments!
 * Launch experiment
   * for winter period,
{{{
  ~nhz/Hirlam start DTG=2007020100 DTGEND=2007022818    # to perform cycled experiments from start cycle DTG to end cycle DTGEND
                                 # by default 48 h forecasts are made at 00 and 12 UTC, 6h fcsts for 06 and 18 UTC
