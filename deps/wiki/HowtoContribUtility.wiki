= Cotribution to the utility bazaar -- HOWTO =

This HOWTO describes the steps for adding your own contribution by a simple
example.

[[PageOutline(2, Contents, inline)]]


== A simple example ==

We assume you have written a neat application script for Hirlam, called
''myscript'', which you want to share with the Hirlam community. Then there are
two steps to add your contribution:


=== 1. The short note ===

Write a short note, which introduces ''myscript'' and which describes its purpose.
Add into this list a link from where ''myscript'' can be downloaded.

Add your note to a wiki page. There are two possibilities:

  1.  Add your note directly into an existing page by choosing `"Edit this page"` at the bottom of the respecive page
  1.  Create a new page by typing its URL into the address field of your browser, e.g. `http://hirlam.org/wiki/MyNewNote`. This will bring up a page with the button "create this page". The page name must consist of a word containing at least two capital letters. When your note is complete edit ToolsUtilities and include !MyNewNote in it.

It is recommended that you make your note using the WikiFormatting. You can then include
a download link to ''myscript'' with

  {{{[source:contrib/foo/bar/myscript download myscript]}}}


=== 2. Add ''myscript'' to the `contrib` repository ===

to be added soon ...
