== Description of carra.beta.1 ==
carra.beta.1 is an intermediate code repository for CARRA toward final CARRA reanalysis system due in April 2019. The repository was branched off from the CARRA development branch dated Oct 25 2018 at changeset [17934]. carra.beta.1 is an evolution from the previously tagged carra.alpha.2 with numerous changes of meteorological impacts, such as 
 * harmonisation of configuration options between east (North Scandinavia and Svalbard) and west (Greenland and Iceland) domains, including adoptation of quadratic grids from the original cubic (west domain) and linear grid (east domain); turning on of OCND2 option for mixing phase microphysics in west domain, and use of SoilGrid for soil data base
 * improvement of physiographic database including correction on ECOCLIMAP II for albedo and LAI in Greeland, correction of glacier mask over Svalbard, correction of land sea mask for Greenland, etc. 
 * use of MODIS derived glacier albedo data to improve description of albedo over permafrost area in Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard
 * use of re-processed, gap free high resolution SST and sea ice analysis data set from ESA-CCI and OSISAF
 * use of local (non-GTS) SYNOP observation data collected from Norway, Finland and Sweden for data assimilation
 * use of surface temperature and humidity observation data collected over Greenland glacier area by GCnet and PROMice network for surface data assimilation
 * assimilation of reprocessed scatterometer (Quickscat, Oceanscat, ASCAT) data in upper air data assimilation
 * assimilation of reprocessed radio occulation bending angle data starting 2006 onwards
 * radio sonde bias correction following that of ECMWF
 * porting of blacklisting information from ERA5 as baseline for blacklist of assimilated observation data
In addition carra.beta.1 also contains several options targeted for CARRA, which are presently candidates for carra.beta.2 upon evaluation,
 * assimilation of satellite snow data in surface assimilation
 * a tuning in snow parameterisation
 * large scale constraint in 3DVAR, Jk
 * incremental analysis update, IAU
 * 3DVAR assimilation of satellite microwave radiance (AMSU, MHS, MSU)
 * 3DVAR assimilation of satellite infrared radiance (IASI)
 * 3DVAR assimilation of reprocessed AMV wind data
 * MESCAN, an improved surface analysis with CANARI
Technically carra.beta.1 also include several updates
 * optimisation of cycling data flow to increase execution throughout at the ECMWF HPC
 * update in verification stationlists
In brief, following table lists main differences in features between carra.alpha.2 and carra.beta.1

=== Anticipated development efforts toward final CARRA system and release plan ===
It is planned that in the coming weeks a series of parallel experimentation will be made to validate the newly tagged carra.beta.1, with focus to consider addition of outstanding development components into the system. Based on these, CARRA re-analysis system is expected to go through further updates in form of a new tagging of intermediate CARRA-versions of carra.beta.2 (Dec 2018) and carra-rc (release Candidates) in Jan 2019. To commit future code corrections or updates, please use [https://hirlam.org/trac/log/branches/CARRA/carra carra development branch). The test activities are mainly around following aspects,  
 * Upper air data assimilation
  * Control of large scale information (Jk vs LSMIX)
  * Derivation of climatological structure function with EDA or Brand scheme
  * Use of evolving structure functions to partly account for changes of observation system
  * Provide a measure of uncertainties for through EDA for selected episodes
  * Assimilation of Radiance, AMV
  * Application of VarBC for aircraft data
  * Use of locally collected observation data
 * Surface data assimilation and representation of sea/ice states
  * assimilation of satellite snow
  * impact of using combined dataset with ESA-CCI and OSISAF on continuity of analysis results
 * Forecast model
  * Improved snow parameterisation
  * Use of ARCTIC DEM data for more accurate representation of orography
  * Code optimisation (optimal use of compilor/options, i/o server, hybrid parallelisation)
  * Development and adaptation about output data stream
  * HARMONIE on extended domain covering North Polar with changed projection
 * Verification and validation
  * CARRA production monitoring/diagnosis platform
  * Collection of station information and extended observation data for verification
  * Field verification
Next CARRA code release, carra.beta.2, is scheduled for mid Dec 2018.
Release candidate of carra.rc.1, is expected by end Jan 2018.
Final release of CARRA repository, carra.1, is expected by mid-April 2019.
