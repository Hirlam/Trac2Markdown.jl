== KNMI Operational Schedule ==

 [http://www.knmi.nl/~tijm/Runschema.html The table] shows the operational run schedule of the KNMI NWP suite.

 [http://www.knmi.nl/~tijm/voortgang.html A Graphic display] shows the status of the runs of the KNMI NWP suite. Every minute a check is made on which files are already created and which run should be active. This is then displayed in the graphical display with different colors for the files that have already been completed and that still have to be created. In the case of a model crash you can then in one instance see which run is complete and on time and which run has crashed or is lagging behind.

== KNMI Hirlam verification ==

 [http://www.knmi.nl/~tijm/HIR72/HIRLAM72.html This javascript] shows the verification of the operational and pre-operational runs.
