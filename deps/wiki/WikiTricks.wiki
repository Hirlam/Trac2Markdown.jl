= Some Elementary Tricks of Working with HIRLAM Wiki Pages =


== Use the buttons/links on the wiki page ==


 * Use 'Browse Source' button to access the HIRLAM source code
   * in https://hirlam.org/trac/browser, 'trunk' -> 'hirlam' will bring you to the hirlam source code directories;
   *  'rev' will display a list of latest changes to the repository
 * 'Wiki' or 'Start Page' button will bring you to the Hirlam system wiki start page
 * 'Title Index' show a complete list of content in the wiki page
 * 'Recent Changes' show a list of latest changes in reverse time order
 * 'Page History' shows each versions of the current page and provide option to compare between versions


== How do I contribute ==

 * If you want to modify any of the exiting wiki pages, just look for the 'edit this page' button and edit! Note that all wiki pages are automatically version controled. That is, unless you have root priviledge, you can not delete any of the current or previous versions of the wiki pages.  (And that's why everybody could be given editing privileges because errors can be corrected afterwards again by others). 
 * If you want to add a new page (e.g., NewPage), just write in the above address line of your browser with
http://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/NewPage, you will be prompted with a 'create this page' button. You may then just proceed.
 * See WikiFormatting and TracWiki for help on editing wiki page
 * Use http://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/SandBox to practice wiki editing!
