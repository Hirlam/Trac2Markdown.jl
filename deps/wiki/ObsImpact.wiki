== '''Report on observation impact study in HARMONIE-AROME data assimilation'' ==

[[Center(end)]]

This page was built to report about experiences with assimilation of different observations in the HARMONIE-AROME data assimilation system. 

=== General remarks ===
   * The impact of surface assimilation compared to downscaling of the lateral boundary files (ECMWF) is significantly positive in the lower troposphere (ARCREF vs ARCSURF in T001);
   * The impact of conventional (radiosonde and few aircraft) observations in the forecasts in the Arctic is neutral (ARCSURF vs ARCCONV in T001);
   * Assimilation of the conventional observation (surface and upper-air) have positive impact mainly in the lower troposphere (ARCREF vs ARCCONV in T001);
   * 

=== Observed possible problems ===
   * Assimilation of radiances needs anchoring good upper-air observations to constrain the VarBC (we use tropospheric predictors in our system) (surf vs surftvs5 in T004). The problem is solved when adding radiosondes and aircraft observations in the upper-air assimilation (ctrl vs tvs5 in T005) (please look on upper-air verif for both T004 and T005, surface verif suffer with less obs. Separate  results exists with more obs in surface (but no upper-air).
