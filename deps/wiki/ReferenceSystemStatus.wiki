== '''Recent reference HIRLAM system''' ==

The present reference HIRLAM system is that of [wiki:Hirlam_7.3], released in Nov 2010. [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/ReleaseNotes7.3 HIRLAM-7.3 ] Hirlam 7.3 is the last official version of the synoptic-scale HIRLAM forecast system released during HIRLAM-A. Compared to Hirlam 7.2, version 7.3 contains as default following main new or updated features:
 * Modified surface scheme with improved parameterisation of surface processes, e.g. that of snow and forest
 * Multi-loop multi incremental 4D-VAR minimisation
 * Modified physical parameterisation, such as those for Kain Fritsh Rasch Kristjansson condensation scheme which is now based on the "RK-eta" and "KF-eta" versions
 * Parameterisation of meso-scale and sub-grid scale orographic impacts (MSO-SSO)
 * SST analysis based on Optimal Interpolation and update of ice cover using interpolated ECMWF analysis; Some improvement on snow analysis
 * Extended use of remote sensing data, with AMSU-A from Noaa 15/16/18 (default), from NOAA 19, Metop 2(optional), AMSU-B/MHS from Noaa 16/18, from NOAA 19, metop 2(optional), AMV (Meteosat 8, optional), ASCAT (optional), Radar !RadiaWind (optional), Ground-based GPS (optional), Ocean Sea-Ice SAF data (optional)
 * Update in background error statistics, tuning in scaling of background error, observation error and bias correction data for ATOVS
 * Modifications related to optional ensemble forecast and hybrid data assimilation
 * System overhaul, cleaning, new utilities and bug fixes

Hirlam-7.3 brings numerous improvement on meteorological quality. Among them, a general improvement in predicted surface temperature especially for diurnal evolution, precipitation especially for small events, surface wind over orographic areas. Meanwhile, some degradation in mean sea level pressure have been observed, and there tends to be a somewhat increased positive bias for surface wind speed.

Prior to the launch of hirlam-7.3, extensive real-time parallel runs with 7.3-release candidates have been run at FMI to ensure quality in technical and meteorological aspects.

On Dec 23 2010, an experimental version of the next HIRLAM release, hirlam-7.4 alpha, is tagged to enable a comprehensive evaluation and further tuning for the final scheduled HIRLAM system release, - Hirlam-7.4, which is now to be delayed to around mid-2011. Technically Hirlam-7.4 has two main features: an improved grid resolution with ca 7 km grid spacing in horizontal and 65-level in vertical with lowest model level at 12 m, a freshwater lake parameterisation (FLAKE). In addition, several other candidate options may be considered once proven to be mature, including that of radiation scheme taking into account of orographic effects, assimilation of ASCAT wind, etc. According to the HIRLAM-B programme plan, no further research will be organised around HIRLAM-system, thus the work on HIRLAM-7.4 will necessarily be kept minimum.

== '''Development of the HARMONIE forecast system''' ==

Also on Dec 23 2010, the first official release of the HIRLAM meso-scale forecast system HARMONIE, harmonie-361.3, is tagged. Harmonie-36h1.3 defines as default an AROME forecast system with 2.5 km grid spacing, 65 vertical level, using 3D-VAR upper air analysis and Optimal Interpolation-based surface analysis scheme and with a direct coupling to ECMWF forecast. Harmonie-36h1.3 is a comprehensive forecast system with a reference script system and numerous utilities including that of gmake-based build tool, MAKEUP, developed within the HIRLAM community. 

Harmonie-36h1.3 is preceded woth two earlier taggings, one alpha version, harmonie-36h1.1 released on July 2 2010 and one beta version, harmonie-36h1.2, released on 29 Oct 2010. These have enabled the HIRLAM development community to perform rigorous check about technical and meteorological aspects of the system. Finally, a comprehensive validation campaign was launched prior to the official release of 36h1.3 to make quality assessment of 36h1.3. From the preliminary evaluation of the validation experiments, it is concluded that 
 * Qualitatively, HARMONIE system provides meteorologically competitive forecasts at scales relevant to the HIRLAM services (at a grid spacing of 2 to 10 km). e.g, AROME forecasts are seen to have adequate skills in forecast of torrential rains in several of the extreme summer episodes 
 * Data assimilation configuration in HARMONIE system provides an adequate quality so that it is feasible for real-time operations
Among the deficiencies observed during the validation runs, progress is desirable for an
 * improved technical efficiency
 * improved modeling of cold nordic winter condition (snow, ice ...) and surface wind in orographic area
 * technical enabling of more remote sensing data

With an official tagging of AROME-based HARMONIE system 36h1.3, HIRLAM-A marks the successful ending of the 5-year research programme with one of the principle targets fulfilled: to deliver a meso-scale forecast system that is suitable for both operational and research applications at member services. Much remain to be improved, but that is the mission of the follow-up programme HIRLAM-B.
