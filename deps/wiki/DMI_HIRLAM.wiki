== NWP system at DMI ==

The current main DMI operational NWP system consists of short range deterministic forecast suites (DKA, GLB) based on meso-scale HARMONIE, multi-physics HIRLAM ensemble forecast system (E05), and a nowcasting suite (RA3) based on HIRLAM. In addition, DMI maintains several regular NWP suites, all of them based on DMI-HIRLAM, to serve different operational purposes.

== DMI-HARMONIE ==

 * Since 2011, DMI has been running routinely kilometer scale (km-scale, alternatively referred to as meso-scale) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model for 2-day forecast for Danish and Greenland territories. The DMI-mesoscale NWP model is based on the HARMONIE forecast system, which is the mesoscale version of the HIRLAM forecast system. Since Sept 16 2013, DMI-HARMONIE has been defined as the main operational forecast system for short range forecast of up to 2 days.
 * HARMONIE as a mesoscale NWP forecast system has been developed with primary focus to improve short range weather forecast for high impact type weather such as summertime strong convection, (flash flood,  thunderstorms) and rapidly developing winter storms, gust and snowstorm. From experience, extreme weather events are most often associated with small spatial and temporal scales and as such, high resolution, frequent and early delivery of weather forecast are necessary.
 * DMI-HARMONIE performs separate model runs for Denmark and southwest Greenland, respectively. Since March 2015, DKA38h12 and GLB38h12 have been the operational mesoscale models at DMI, in which "DKA" and "GLB" refer to the current model domains and 38h12 refers to the reference HARMONIE version 38h1.2 as released by the HIRLAM program. 
 * One of the innovative features in the DMI-HARMONIE is the asynoptic cycling scheme implemented for the Danish DKA forecasting domain since Dec 2012. DKA features a 3-hourly data assimilation with 3DVAR, followed by a 58 h forecast 8 times a day. In order to make optimal use of computational resources, the cycling of DKA runs is configoured around asynoptic base time, in which the analysis, hence starting time for forecast integration, is shifted by 1 h ahead of the conventional base hour. Thanks to the design with the shifted base time, DMI has been able to implement a computationally intensive HARMONIE RUC (Rapid Update Cycling) assimilation alongside the other existing operational suites since 2012, resulting in a significantly improved utilisation of the HPC (High Performance Computation) resources at DMI. Introduction of asynoptic cycling for Danish domain has proven to be able to maintain good forecast quality, and deliver more frequent and longer forecast with a much improved timeliness.
 * DMI-HARMONIE uses three dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) for assimilation of observation data in the cycling for DKA38h12. Apart from conventional synoptic observation data as obtained from global telecommunication system (GTS), DKA38h12 currently assimilats satellite data from ATOVS (AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS, ATMS), AMV (from MSG 10), E-AMDAR aircraft observation, M-EHS MODE-S observation (as relayed via KNMI), surface temperature and humidity observation from Danish road network. In addition, a pre-operational experimental cycling suite has been in regular, parallel run since July 2015 in which reflectivity data from radars in Denmark and 9 neigbouraing countries, GPS radio occutation data, have been used.
 * For GLB domain, due to a very limited available observation data, 3DVAR is not performed currently. Instead, an upper air blending scheme has been used to incorporate large scale information from short range forecast of the ECMWF to secure adequate large scale model states. Optimal interpolation is used for surface assimilation in GLB so as to use screen level surface observations. GLB38h12 currently runs 54h forecast 4 times a day, with launch time at 03, 09, 15 and 21 UTC, this in view of available computational resource.
ECMWF short range forecast are used in DMI-HARMONIE for direct lateral boundary coupling. ECMWF forecast boundary data are delivered 4 times a day with ca 15 km grid resolution and hourly interval. In addition, for surface SST and ice cover, interpolated ECMWF analysis are used.

=== RCR-DMI ===

 * Since March 2014, in cooperation with HIRLAM-B programme, DMI offers to act as operational service to run Regular Cycle of Reference (RCR) HARMONIE for officially released forecast system of HARMONIE-38h1 on one of its operational HARMONIE suite, DKA. According to the agreement, RCR-DKA shall be an operationally used NWP suite with basic system as close as possible to that of the officially tagged reference repository. In addition, monitoring data about forecast and performance measures of the RCR-DKA needs to be made publically availble timely to the HIRLAM community and adequately archived. 
 * Main deviation of the RCR-DKA from the reference release
   * Source
    * 2014.03.09: a local tuning to increase surface drag in order to secure reduced wind bias for Danish territory. (xcdrag=0.03)
    * 2015.03.10: activation of subgrid scale drag (sso) scheme to reduce further wind bias for Danish territory. Note that this action affects negatively on wind forecast for mountaneous area.
    * 2015.06.20: replacement of turbulence/shall convection scheme EDMFM by the alternative option EDKF, this in order to reduce excessive cloud cover as seen in the HARMONIE forecast for Danish stations.
   * Configuration
    * Asynoptic cycling. This has been implemented since Dec 2012 for DKA37.
    * additional use of observation data AMV, E-MHS mode-s, ATMS, screenlevel observation of Danish road network.

=== Version Upgrade with DMI-HARMONIE ===

 * 2015.06.20, upgrade with switchover of turbulence/shallow convection option EDMFM to EDKF with intended impact on reduced cloud cover. Danish road station observations for surface temperature and humidity are used. Satellite ATMS data turned on. 
 * 2015.03.10, upgrade to 38h1.2 with snow depth data assimilation turned on.
 * 2014.03.16, switch over to 38h1.1 with start of RCR-DMI.
 * 2013.09.15, DKA37 for operational production with 3-hourly cycling
 * 2013.01.02, parallel forecast with asynoptic 37h1.2 for DKA domain and normal forecast length up to 58h
 * 2012.08.11, regular HARMONIE forecast with 36h1.4 on DKA domain with 36h forecast and 6h interval

== DMI-HIRLAM ==

DMI currently still maintains NWP suites based on HIRLAM forecast system. DMI-HIRLAM are originated from earlier versions of reference HIRLAM, with selective updates in the recent years to match some of the new features in the reference releases up to 7.3.1. It also includes adaptations to the computational and operational environment at DMI (Cray computers). The most recent major upgrade happened at 24 April 2012. As of 2011 the coarse resolution domain T15 is no longer official suite. Since Sept 2013, HIRLAM-SKA has also been replaced by HARMONIE-DKA as official forecast for Danish area.
