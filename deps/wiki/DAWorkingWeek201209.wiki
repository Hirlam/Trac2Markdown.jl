== Outline ==

The working week is to address such questions as the design and implementation of the 4D-Var AROME, EDA/LETKF and design of the hybrid variational DA for HARMONIE, treatment of phase-errors, climatological variability of structure functions, heterogeneous B-matrix. We will devote some time for more technical things as well: an overview of the basic structure of the minimization algorithm in the HARMONIE (IFS) framework and the implementation of VARBC.

The aim of the WW is
 * to get overview where do we stands now, in order to coordinate our developments and resources
 * to exchange knowledge on the problems experienced and achievements obtained, in order to speed up progress
   * correction of phase-errors and flow-dependent balances;
   * climatological variability of structure functions and variational data assimilation;
   * towards cloud data assimilation and initialisation  of humidity;
   * the HIRLAM experience with the hybrid ensemble variational data assimilation and lagged ensemble;
   * LETKF in the IFS framework;     
 * to discuss and hopefully come to the common position on the strategical questions:
   * what is the optimal design of the 4DVAR for meso-scales (the length of the assimilation window, the length of the observation window, what processes should be involved in the TL/AD propagation of the increment);
   * what is the most promising technique for meso-scales: 4DVAR with full rank covariance or 4DEnVar with a non-linear ensemble evolution
   * what development should we prioritize for meso-scales: RUC with large number of high-resolution observations and a static background error covariance or flow-dependent propagation of background error covariance
   * do we need variational data assimilation for "moist" observations
 * to come out with a more clear understanding in what algorithmic development we should invest and how can we use limited manpower resources in the most efficient way 
 * to build up competence in the  HARMONIE Forecasting system: the emphasis is the basic structure of minimisation algorithm in the HARMINIE/IFS and the implementation of the VARBC. 

== The Key points for the discussion ==
 The key points are:

 * flow-dependent structures are needed to feed the convection-resolving model with "moist" observations;
 * the live length of the convective phenomena is short;
 *  high-frequency high-resolution observations exist and they mostly have non-linear relation to the model state;
 * non-additive (phase) errors are present in the background state of the remote sensing observations;
 * "physical" balances should be used correcting "moist" processes;
 * ensemble prediction system may be used to estimate the forecast error-of-the-day;
 * ensemble methods are very expensive for small services;
 * 4D Variational data assimilation condition the model state to observations in a dynamically consistent way and reduced significantly the rate of the error growth
 *  the configuration of the observation network plays an important role for the efficiency of the RUC setup (both upper air and the lower troposphere observations should be present)
 * the large scale should be preserve/proper represented in the LAM
 * the domain size and the forecast length should be chosen adequately to describe the phenomena of interest
 * the 4DVAR an expensive technique but the hybrid ensemble variational data assimilation methods are not less expensive, if one takes ensemble generation into account
 

 From the expertise on these key points, one should put priorities on what to do and when: 
 ||RUC development (1h/3h frequency)||hybrid ensemble variational development||non-additive error correction||4DVAR||4DEnsVAR||
