= Background =
The observation operator in ARPEGE/IFS/HARMONIE is a quite big mess with different procedures carried out in one subroutine. The OOPS imposed refactoring aims to split the ARPEGE/IFS/HARMONIE observation operator into modular parts: observation vector (observed quantities, observation locations, observation standard deviations/covariances), GOM_PLUS (projection of the model state variables to the horizontal observation locations), call for observation operator itself (vertical interpolation + H) + variational bias correction option as auxiliary control variable. A workshop was held with participants from ECMWF, Météo France and HIRLAM in july 2015.
