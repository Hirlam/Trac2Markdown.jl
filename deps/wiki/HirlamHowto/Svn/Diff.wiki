== Tips on viewing differences between source code versions ==

The basic command to view differences between revisions of files or directories is [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.ref.svn.c.diff.html svn diff].[[BR]]
Also, if you want to inspect the changes of a particular changeset, this can be done from wiki links under 'Browse Source'.[[BR]]
However, in some situations you may experience that the above methods give output that is difficult to read, in particular because real changes get
drowned in details about mergeinfo (or property changes).

The first thing you might consider is to use a graphical diff program (such as [http://furius.ca/xxdiff/ xxdiff] or [http://meld.sourceforge.net/ meld])
with subversion. To do so, you should edit {{{~/.subversion/config}}} and change or introduce {{{diff-cmd}}} in the {{{[helpers]}}} section.
In case of xxdiff, you should download [http://xxdiff.sourceforge.net/local/bin/xxdiff-subversion xxdiff-subversion] and point
{{{diff-cmd}}} to this script. In case of meld, you can point to it directly, e.g. {{{diff-cmd = /usr/bin/meld}}}.[[BR]]
Then, when you execute 'svn diff' property changes will still scroll by in your terminal window, but every time a real file change occurs,
the graphical diff tool gets executed. Quite an improvement.

But even this could sometimes be a bit annoying, because the list of changes can be very long, and you may be interested in only parts of it.
Say you ask yourself the following question: What are the local differences in Harmonie release 36h1.1 relative to the !ClearCase version
it is based on? As indicated above, you can do:
{{{
   svn diff https://svn.hirlam.org/vendor/aladin/cy36t1_bf.08 https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-36h1.1/src
}}}
but you will get one invocation of your graphical viewer for every file, in alpabetical order.

In [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/trunk/contrib/util] there is a utility [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/trunk/contrib/util/tdiff tdiff]
that you could also consider using. It was created to do (recursive) directory differences, but the latest version will also accept
two subversion URLs as arguments. This means that you don't have to 'svn co/export' the directories in question before diffing them.
In the above example, you can do
{{{
   tdiff https://svn.hirlam.org/vendor/aladin/cy36t1_bf.08 https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-36h1.1/src
}}}
and you will then get 3 listboxes, the center one shows files that differ, the left one files only found in the
first URL directory tree, and the right one files unique to the second URL directory tree. If you would like to
see how a file differs, left-click on it and select 'Diff' from the popup menu.
