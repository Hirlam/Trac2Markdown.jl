 * 'Wiki' or 'Start Page' button will bring you to the Hirlam system wiki home page

 * 'Recent Changes' show a list of latest changes in reverse time order
 * 'Page History' shows each versions of the current page and provide option to compare between versions

== How do I browse the HIRLAM source codes? ==

Use 'Browse Source' button to access the HIRLAM source code
 * in https://hirlam.org/trac/browser, 'trunk' -> 'hirlam' will bring you to the hirlam source code directories;
 *  'rev' will display a list of latest changes to the repository

== How do I become a registed user of the System wikipage? ==
Almost all the content in the HIRLAM system wiki pages can be edited directly by registered HIRLAM staffs. If you already have an user-id at the HexNet, you can use it in the system wiki page as well. Otherwise you can write to xiaohua@dmi.dk to acquire one.
 
== How do I contribute ==

You need first to login as personal user in order to work on the content in a wiki page. 

To modify any of the exiting wiki pages, just look for the 'edit this page' button and start editing! Note that all wiki pages are automatically version controled. That is, unless you have root priviledge, you can not delete permanently any of the current or previous versions of the wiki pages.  --- That's why everybody could be given editing privileges because errors can be corrected afterwards again by others. 

If you want to add a new page (e.g., NewPage), just write in the above address line of your browser with
http://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/NewPage, you will be prompted with a 'create this page' button. You may then just proceed.

See WikiFormatting and TracWiki for help on editing wiki page.
