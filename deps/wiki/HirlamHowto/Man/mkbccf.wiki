The  mkbccf  program  uses  the [wiki:HirlamHowto/Man/nukem nukem] subroutine to read the input file.

NAME
       mkbccf - tool for generating ATOVS Bias Coefficient Correction Files (BCCF files).

SYNTAX
       mkbccf.x < mkbccf.in

AVAILABILITY
       The program source code is in hirlam/mainsrc/mkbccf.F

DESCRIPTION
       The bias between the ATOVS observations and their simulated equivalent 
       (innovation) is usually much larger than the signal itself.
       
       The BCCF files are used to correct the ATOVS bias in HIRLAM 3D-Var. The 
       mkbccf program reads the contents of the bias correction database and 
       generates BCCF files. The bias correction database is maintaned by the program 
       putbias.x.

       The BCCF files are typically generated operationally by using the most recent 
       30 day period of data. However, the BCCF files can also be static, but the 
       user must then monitor the bias statistics to ensure that the bias does not
       shift.

       Headers
       The  mkbccf  program  uses  the NUKE subroutine to read the input file.
       Enter the command 'x' to retrieve a list of the valid headers.
       The following headers will be accepted :

 MKBCCF V1.0 [0]VFMLR
   data body - none. Optional

 SATELLITE AND INSTRUMENT [1]VFLR &
   data body - 1 line. Name of satellite and instrument (e.g. "noaa16 amsu-a").

 BIAS FILE DIRECTORY [1]VFLR %1&2
   data body - 1 line. Path to bias correction database directory. The files in this
   directory are maintained by the program putbias.

Either:
    START DATE [1]VFLR %1&2
      data body - 1 line. Start date (e.g. 2006/12/31 24:60:60.000) of the period
      used for generating the BCCF files.

    END DATE [1]VFLR %1&2
      data body - 1 line. End date (e.g. 2007/03/31 24:60:60.000) of the period
      used for generating the BCCF file.

or:
    EXTRACT FROM BIAS FILES [*]VFLR %1&1
      data body - many lines. List of bias correction database files used for generating
      the BCCF file.

 BIAS CORRECTION COEFFICIENTS INDEX FILE [1]VFLR&
   data body - 1 line. Name of BCCF index file. The index file specifies where the 
   different BCCF files are located. The index file is generated if it does not exist.
   The BCCF files are the put in the "bias correction coefficient directory" (see below).

 BIAS CORRECTION COEFFICIENTS DIRECTORY [1]VFLR&
   data body - 1 line. Path to the default location of the BCCF files.
