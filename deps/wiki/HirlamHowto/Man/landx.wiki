The  landx  program  uses  the [wiki:HirlamHowto/Man/nukem nukem] library to read the input file.

NAME
       landx - tool for pre-processing ATOVS observations.

SYNTAX
       landx.x < landx.in

AVAILABILITY
       The program source code is in hirlam/mainsrc/landx.F

DESCRIPTION
       The landx program processes ATOVS 2a collocation files and generates new 2a files. 
       The 2a files are converted to and from BUFR files (which are read by HIRLAM
       3D-Var) by the program hitmerge. The user may for instance use the landx program 
       to group ATOVS pass 2a files to single files, one for each assimilation cycle.
 
       Headers
       The  landx  program  uses  the NUKE subroutine to read the input file.
       Enter the command 'x' (or '?') to retrieve a list of the valid headers.
       The following headers will be accepted :

 LANDX V1.0 [0]VFMLR
   data body - none. Optional.

 MINIMUM DISTANCE BETWEEN OBS (DEG) [1]VFMLR
   data body - 1 line. Distance between observations in output file in degrees. 
   This header will activate observation thinning. Optional

 MAXIMUM CLOUD LIQUID WATER (OPEN SEA), AMSU-A (MM) [1] %3&$
    data body - 1 line. Maximum allowed CLW over open sea based on NOAA
    algorithm. This header activates a cloud mask for AMSU-A. Optional.

 INPUT MERGED HIRLAM, SATELLITE DATA FILE (LEVEL 2A) [*]VFLR &
   data body - many lines. List of 2a ATOVS collocation input files. These
   files are generated by hitmerge.

 OUTPUT SATELLITE OBSERVATION FILE (LEVEL 2A, YY MM DD HH MI SAT INS) [1]VFMLR &2%1&1
   data body - 1 line. Pattern for the name of the output 2a file. The wildcards 
   "YY", "MM" etc. found in the file name will be substituted with the year, month 
   etc. and "SAT" and "INS" will be substituted by the satellite name (e.g. noaa15)
   and the instrument name (e.g. amsu-a).

 GROUP OUTPUT TO FOLLOWING HOURS [*] &2%1&1$
   data body - many lines. Assimilation cycle hour (for instance "12"). 

 REJECT LAND SURFACES [0] %3&
   data body - none. Flag for rejecting observation over land. Optional.

 REJECT OPEN SEA SURFACES [0] %3&
   data body - none. Flag for rejecting observation over open sea. Optional.

 REJECT SEA ICE SURFACES [0] %3&
   data body - none. Flag for rejecting observation over sea ice. Optional.

 REJECT MIXED SURFACES [0] %3&
   data body - none. Flag for rejecting observation over a combination of 
   surface types. Optional.

 IGNORE CORRUPTED INPUT FILES [0]
   data body - none. Flag to ignore corrupted 2a input files. The program
   will otherwise abort if a corrupt or non-existent input file is encountered. 
   Optinal.
