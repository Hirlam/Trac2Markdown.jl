The  putbias  program  uses  the [wiki:HirlamHowto/Man/nukem nukem] library to read the input file.

NAME
       putbias - tool for maintaining ATOVS bias correction database.

SYNTAX
       putbias.x < putbias.in

AVAILABILITY
       The program source code is in hirlam/mainsrc/putbias.F

DESCRIPTION
       There is a large bias between the ATOVS observations and their simulated
       model equivalent. The program putbias maintaines a bias correction database
       that is used by the program mkbccf to generate BCCF files that are used
       by 3D-Var to correct the ATOVS bias. 

       The program putbias takes the output file 'rtm.raw' from rtmtocma.x, which
       lists all innovations in the cma-file (generated by an earlier HIRLAM 3D-Var run),
       and generates statistics which is put into the bias correction database.

       Headers
       The  putbias  program  uses  the NUKE subroutine to read the input file.
       Enter the command 'x' (or '?') to retrieve a list of the valid headers.
       The following headers will be accepted :


 PUTBIAS V1.0 [0]VFMLR
   data body - none. Optional.

 RAW BIAS INPUT FILE [1]VFLR &
    data body - 1 line. Name of raw innovation file (generated by rtmtocma).

 BIAS FILE DIRECTORY [1]VFLR &
    data body - 1 line. Path to ATOVS bias correction database directory.
    The database will contain binary files, one for each day. These files contain
    a register with all passes that day. The register is used to ensure that the same
    data is not used twice.

 FORCE ALL DATA INTO BIAS DIRECTORY [0]
   data body - none. Flag to override the pass-register so that all input data is
   recorded in the bias correction database, even if the register indicates that the
   data has been recorded earlier. Use this option with cation. Optional.
