== Highlights of 7.2.2 ==

Hirlam-7.2.2 is a minor "facelift" update over the current official Hirlam reference system, [wiki:Hirlam_7.2], which implements a correction to overcome excessive deep soil ice reservoir. A large amount of soil ice accumulated over winter has been seen to result in a large negative bias in night time surface temperature during winter and spring, (see the attached report by Sander Tijm). In addition, it ports several system updates and bug corrections as installed in the developing versions for Hirlam-7.3

Hirlam-7.2.2 replaces Hirlam-7.2 as the current/official Hirlam reference release

Overall the meteorological impact of the update is estimated to be minor, except for the improvement in winter/spring night time surface temperature

The complete source code of Hirlam 7.2.2 can be obtained by using either

 * Subversion command
{{{
   svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/hirlam-7.2.2
}}}
 * or source code tarball, available from ECMWF ecgate:/scratch/ms/dk/nhz/hirlam-7.2.2.tar.gz or ecfs:/hirlam/src/tar/hirlam-7.2.2.tar.gz which contains the sandbox (check-out version) of the Hirlam 7.2.2

== Updates in Hirlam-7.2.2 ==

 1. ECMWF platform changes for front-end servers and MARS client; bug correction associated with MARS staging at ECMWF platform ([8156], Yang]
 1. Adaptation to the changes from BUFR Edition 3 to BUFR Edition 4 in assimilated observation data , (AMV, and soon for ATOVS as well), ([8163], Amstrup)

== Hirlam 7.2.2 bugfix versions ==

 * [log:tags/hirlam-7.2.2.bf1 hirlam-7.2.2.bf1] contains the following changes 
   * Lake fixes [9297]

 The only meteorological impact is through the corrected lake temperatures.

 The code can be downloaded from: 

{{{
   svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/hirlam-7.2.2.bf1
}}}


== How to run Hirlam 7.2.2 ==

On ECMWF, the reference setting assumes dual platform ecgate-c1a. To set up and initiate experiments using 7.2.2, do, e.g.,
{{{
   mkdir $HOME/hl_home/test722; cd $HOME/hl_home/test722
   ~nhz/Hirlam setup      #  --- some additional configuration settings ---
   ~nhz/Hirlam start DTG=2008101000 DTGEND=2008101006
}}}
