Direct radiative impacts of atmospheric aerosols on meteorological conditions over Europe (V. Toll PhD thesis)
https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Aerosol/Toll_PhDthesis.pdf

Main findings relevant for limited area NWP over Europe
1) For situation with high AOD meteorological forecast can be considerably improved (SW flux and surface energy fluxes in general, near surface temperature, vertical profile of temperature etc.) by using realistic AOD distributions for radiative transfer instead of assuming average climatological effect of aerosols.
2) For situation with AOD close to the long-term average weak sensitivity to aerosol distribution used was found in meteorological forecasts (forecast of SW radiation could still be improved), it is fine to assume climatological aerosol effect during such conditions (and aerosol climatology following Tegen et al. 1997 is O.K. to use over Europe).

Recent evidence suggests that cloud water responses to aerosols are weak on average, both LWP increases and decreases can occur depending on the meteorological conditions.
In this light, parameterizing LWP response to aerosols in NWP model based on real-time aerosol concentrations (i.e. via modification of autoconversion) is highly questionable.

=== Current representation of the direct radiative effect of aerosols in HARMONIE ===

* Aerosol climatology following Tegen et al. (1997) used by default
The usage of Tegen aerosol climatology follows the usage in ECMWF IFS model documented in
http://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/16648-part-iv-physical-processes.pdf

AOD550 of different aerosol species serves as input fields.
Aerosols are distributed vertically according to climatological vertical profiles following Tanre et al. (1984).
SW spectral single scattering albedos, asymmetry parameters and wavelength dependence of AOD is parameterized following Hess et al. (1998) GADS/OPAC.
https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/arpifs/phys_radi/suaersn.F90
LW properties are defined in 
https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/arpifs/phys_radi/suaerl.F90

Climatology is written to monthly climate files in (AOD550 is read from ascii)
https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/aladin/c9xx/eincli9.F90


'''Open questions'''

1) To the Tegen climatology constant AOD550 value of 0.03 is added as tropospheric background
https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/arpifs/phys_ec/suaerv.F90

2) For stratospheric AOD550 value of 0.045 is used as background
https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/arpifs/phys_ec/suaerv.F90
It should be tested what is the influence of using such high value (representative for major volcanic eruptions).

3) When using another aerosol climatology or near-realtime data these background values (tropospheric+stratospheric) might not be appropriate to be used.


'''Current workflow in model for aerosol direct radiative effect'''

* 1) Tegen AOD550 selection based on current month 

In scr/Climate appropriate Tegen monthly AOD file is linked to aero_GL

ln -sf $HM_CLDATA"/aero_tegen"/aero.tegen.m${MM}_GL aero_GL

* 2) Reading AOD550 and writing to fa-format climate file

Climatological vertically integrated AOD550 fields of SEA (sea salt), LAND (organic carbon), SOOT (black carbon?), DESERT (dust) aerosols are read from ASCII aero.tegen_GL files and written to monthly climate files by https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/aladin/c9xx/eincli9.F90 . There is no separate SULPHATE in the present aero.tegen files although such is obtainable in http://gacp.giss.nasa.gov/data_sets/transport/ .

Climatological AOD550 is read into ZFLD array.

Horizontal interpolation to model domain
CALL EINTER2(ZFLD,IDATY,IDATX,IFLD,ZRES,IYFING,IXFING,ITFING,&
& EDELX,EDELY,NPINT,ICO,NULOUT)

ZRES contains interpolated data copied to ZS

Biperiodization of AOD550 fields and writing to fa-format climate file is done
CALL EBICLI(IFLD,INIVL,CLPRE,CLSUF,INUM,ZS,LLBIP,LLWRI,LLPAC) 

* 3) Initialization of AOD550 arrays

AOD550 (SEA, LAND, SOOT, DESERT) fields are initialized from climate FA file (VCLIA)
in /src/arpifs/setup/sugrida.F90 

Group VCLIA for AOD550 of different aerosol types defined in
src/arp/module/surface_fields_mix.F90

From mf_phys.F90 AOD550 is passed to apl_arome.F90/aplpar.F90 as
PSD_VA(1,YSD_VA%YSEA%MP  ) , PSD_VA(1,YSD_VA%YLAN%MP ) , PSD_VA(1,YSD_VA%YSOO%MP ) , PSD_VA(1,YSD_VA%YDES%MP ) , PSD_VA(1,YSD_VA%YSUL%MP ) , PSD_VA(1,YSD_VA%YVOL%MP )

* 4) Vertical distribution of AOD550 and adding backgroud AOD values 

/src/phys_radi/suecrad.F90 calls src/arpifs/phys_ec/suaerv.F90 at the initial time. suaerv defines vertical profiles (see Tanre et al. 1984, IFS phys doc) for the four climatological vertically integrated Tegen AOD550 fields and defines constant values to the tropospheric background and stratospheric ash and sulphate background variables. In /src/arpifs/phys_dmn/radaer.F90 AOD550 each type of aerosols is distributed vertically to get AOD550 of different aerosol types for model layers.

From apl_arome.F90/aplpar.F90 radaer.F90 is called. It returns ZAER with AOD550 of different aerosol types on model layers.

      CALL RADAER ( KIDIA , KFDIA , KLON  , KLEV,&
       & PAPRS , PAPRSF, PT    , PTS,&
       & ZAESEA, ZAELAN, ZAESOO, ZAEDES, ZAESUL, ZAEVOL, &
       & ZAER,  ZAERINDS                                 )

Note that by default (stratospheric) options LAEROSUL and LAEROVOL are set to false, thus in apl_arome.F90 AODs of the corresponding species are set to zero before giving them as input to radaer.F90. The three-dimensional output array ZAER(JL,JK,:) now contains:

|| ZAER(JL,JK,1) || LAND   || aero.tegen land + tropospheric background (total 0.03) ||
|| ZAER(JL,JK,2) || SEA    || aero.tegen sea                                         ||
|| ZAER(JL,JK,3) || DESERT || aero.tegen desert                                      ||
|| ZAER(JL,JK,4) || URBAN  || aero.tegen soot                                        ||
|| ZAER(JL,JK,5) ||        || stratospheric sulphate (total 0.007)                   ||
|| ZAER(JL,JK,6) ||        || stratospheric background (total 0.045)                 ||


* 5) AOD550 to (SW) radiation

From apl_arome.F90 for the default  ifs radiation (LRAYFM is true) AOD550 is input through acradin.F90 → recmwf.F90→ radlsw.F90→ radlsw.F90→sw.F90 (and for lw.F90) → sw1s.F90/swni.F90→swclr.F90 (clear sky fraction of layer)

* 6) AOD550 to SW spectral intervals; aerosol SW single scattering albedos and SW asymmetry parameters

In  swclr.F90
USE YOESW    , ONLY : RTAUA    ,RPIZA    ,RCGA
(RTAUA    ,RPIZA    ,RCGA values are set in /src/arpifs/phys_radi/suaersn.F90 following Hess et al. (1998); GADS/OPAC)
In suaersn, 


{{{
!-- The six aerosol types are respectively:

!  1/ continental average                 2/ maritime
!  3/ desert                              4/ urban
!  5/ volcanic active                     6/ stratospheric background


}}}

AOD550 for different aerosol types contained in PAER is used to calculate AOD in different spectral intervals using RTAUA (ratio between AOD550 and AOD in respective spectral interval).
Effective (combining different aerosol types into one) aerosol single scattering albedos and asymmetry parameters are calculated assuming external mixture of aerosols.

=== Renewal of the climatological aerosol in HARMONIE ===

* Climatological aerosol is used only by the radiation parametrizations (aerosol direct effect) as explained above. MACC reanalysis/CAMS (Inness et al., 2013) aerosol climatology is an option to use instead of TEG97. 

* CAMS aerosol species
Sea Salt (3 bins)
Dust (3 bins)
Organic Matter (Hydrophilic,Hydrophobic)
Black Carbon (Hydrophilic,Hydrophobic)
Sulphate

* The same vertical distributions currently used for the Tegen et al. (1997) climatology with an exponential decay with scale height could be used following Tanre et al. for CAMS data

'''Phase 0: Converting CAMS 11 species to 4 Tegen classes'''

Tools and input data that allow to produce aero_cams ASCII files for reading into the HARMONIE present climate generation. Minimum comments are inside the script Run_MACC2Tegen.sh 

https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Aerosol/MACC2Tegen.tgz

Update of the preparation data and tools of 30.3.2019 (by Laura Rontu) includes also handling of aerosol inherent optical properties: https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Aerosol/camsaero2har.tgz 

Usage of these data requires modification of HARMONIE scr/Climate sms/Climate.sms sms/config_exp.h , https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/aladin/c9xx/eincli9.F90 and some others. An update is being prepared for harmonie-43, available already in git repository .../users/rontu/... dev_rontu_upd branch.



'''Phase 1: Usage of CAMS 11 mass mixing ratios together with the optical properties for 11 classes'''
   (notes by LR and J-PP 22 November 2017, edited by LR 24 May 2019)

1. Climate generation (each month):
 
   Introduce the 11 MMR fields to the monthly m-climate files in the similar way as now the 4 Tegen AOD550 fields

2. Initialization of forecast model (setup of each cycle)

   * Obtain the optical properties extinction coefficient, asymmetry factor and single-scattering albedo from CAMS/ECMWF

     all are functions of wavelength, hydrophilic also on humidity, desert dust and sea aerosol on size 

   * Read the input optical properties during initialization of each forecast cycle (from ascii file const/rrtm_const/RADAIOP)

   * Retain the old definitions of exponential functions for vertical distribution 

3. Calculations during runtime (each time step) 

   Distribute the 2D aerosol MMR vertically, possibly retain stratospheric background values (renewed radaer.F90) 

   A new subroutine (aeropt) to calculate the 3D real-time optical properties

   * input: 2D MMRs (2D aerosol species) and optical property arrays, model state including needed humidity, temperature etc information

   * output:  AOD, g, SSA at each level and location for needed SW and LW spectral intervals - but aerosol types combined!

   * pass these ready-made columns to any radiation scheme, which can then continue with simplified calculation of aerosol radiative transfer specific to each scheme

   Advantages of this approach:

 * The same aerosol input for any radiation scheme

 * No need to know the optical properties for different aerosol species inside the radiation schemes

 * Aerosol MMRs might be used by the cloud-precipitation microphysics

 * The same approach is applicable for the use of real-time and climatological aerosol

=== Early comments ===


'''Comparison between aerosol climatologies'''

* AOD550 in Europe and globally, based on SILAM reanalysis 2000 - 2015, is compared in https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Aerosol/Toll_extra.pdf to Tegen and MACv1. 

Mikhail comments the differences from SILAM point of view:

Globally, the biggest difference is over Saharan area and downwind, which should be just corrected: SILAM is wrong there and we know, why. The run with EC-OPERational data produces something like the attached pictures (2015 EC-operational meteorology, secondary organics was only from biogenic isoprene, rest included).

Less trivial is south Africa, where we show powerful fire smoke, MACC goes pretty low and Tegen shows nothing. Among these, I would rather believe SILAM or go a bit below: the MACC fire source is known to under-estimate aerosols and I can only guess how much can be rectified by the assimilation (did well in 2010 in Russia though). There is a good chance that the next version of our IS4FIRES will be more conservative but already current one is not too bad – see attached paper.

Peaks of AOD in Central Europe are indeed visible from time to time but I would be more conservative than MACC: mean level of 0.3 is really a lot. We can be somewhat low. China and India are and will be a problem for everyone but I am kind-of fine with our PM there, except for deserts in the north, of course – they are better in the attached AODs for 2015.

Marine is fine in MACC and SILAM – differences are quite small and I would hesitate to declare a winner: depends on the region. Interestingly, the 60S belt is or is not visible depending on the instrument you take. MODIS shows it quite clearly – and MACC picks it from there (sea salt source in IFS is not too good). But, e.g. MISR flying on the same Terra shows much less. Our source term is pretty good and it shows peaks less pronounced and closer to the equator. The tropical high-AOD regions are over-stated in SILAM, if believing to MODIS. The reason is temperature-dependent sea salt production, with the sensitivity being pretty high. However, I see little possibilities to change this in the model: we are based on very decent lab tests, which unequivocally show the relation.

One last thing. MODIS is a nice tool but has a funny feature related to AOD: cloud contamination. At the edge of cloud, they tend to show high AOD instead of screening out the pixel. When you average, these pixels push up your mean value. A way to verify the effect is to require that, for instance, 1x1 degree grid cell must have 50 valid MODIS retrievals (pixels are ~ 10x10km) to be valid, for each hour. The effect is strong: see attached. I do not know how MACC treats such cases but unless they make draconian screening, high bias in semi-cloudy regions is quite probable.

'''Comment by Kristian, 24 Oct 2016'''

The aerosol properties that are important for the direct effects in the radiation scheme are:

* The optical depth (AOD, unit -), which is the mass extinction coefficient [m²/g] X the aerosol load [g/m²]
* The single scattering albedo (SSA, unit -)
* The asymmetry factor (g unit -)

... for each layer and spectral band in the SW and the optical depths for each layer and spectral band in the LW. Except for the aerosol load these are the inherent optical properties (IOPs).

For indirect effects the following variables are the most important:

* The cloud droplet number concentration (unit 1/m³)
* The fraction of ice cloud to total cloud water (unit -)

If all of these are known, the radiation scheme does not need the aerosol types as input! Ideally, both of the two latter variables should be used before the radiation calculations to calculate the cloud physical properties:

* Liquid cloud water load (unit g/m²)
* Ice cloud load (unit g/m²)
* Cloud droplet effective radius (unit µm)
* Ice cloud equivalent radius (unit µm)

From the authors of the LIMA scheme I understand that LIMA accounts for aerosol-cloud interactions (nucleation, scavenging) in the following way:

- Transport of aerosol is done by the resolved flow and turbulence
- CCN activation (Cohard and Pinty, 2000) →cloud droplets
- IFN nucleation (Phillips et al. 2008, 2013) → ice crystals
- Below-cloud aerosol washing-out by rain (Berthet et al.2010)

And in the initial inclusion of the scheme there is a homogeneous intial aerosol concentration. In a presentation by B. Vié during the strategy meeting in Toulouse in May he wrote:

What precision in the representation of aerosols do we need ?
- Homogeneous initial population ? (currently assumed)
- Realistic aerosol population ?
   - MACC analyses can be used to provide realistic 3D initial and lateral boundary conditions for aerosols (under development)
   - Including data assimilation / nudging ?
- Complete aerosol scheme, including sources, ageing... ?
   - Emission schemes for dust and sea-salt
   - Complete chemistry-aerosol module ORILAM (Tulet et al. 2005, Meso-NH)
