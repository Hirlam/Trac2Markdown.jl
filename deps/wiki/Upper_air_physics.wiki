  || DY1.1    ||  Boundary conditions and nesting ||  CoCl || Check vertical interpolation in gl, study impact of different vertical interpolation between fullpos and gl || ETAETA studied, PBL-parameter causes differences, changing PBL has small to negligible impact || [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Upper_air_physics/vertintFeb2019.pdf Vertical interpolation report February 2019] ||
  || DY2    ||  Time-stepping algorithms ||  CoCl || Check and research settings in the dynamics || Wave pattern reported by MetEireann. Investigated by Colm, many experiments. Waves develop when U very close to DX/dt. MetE setup NOHARATU. With HARATU no waves. PC has negative impact. VESL increase removes waves. Settings coupled to the PC scheme applied in SETTLS also have a significant impact, prevent waves from developing. || [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Upper_air_physics/Report_Colm_noise_20190221.pdf Dynamics settings report February 2019] ||
