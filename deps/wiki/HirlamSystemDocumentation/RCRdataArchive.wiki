=== HIRLAM RCR data archive ===
The HIRLAM forecast model writes its primary output to history file (fcyyyymmdd_hh+lll), which is designed to be a complete snap shot of the model state described by HIRLAM model for a particular time point ( in even hour). In addition, through specification of namelist NAMPPP more model output including post-processing/diagnostic fields can be written out during the forecast model integration, such as those model diagnostics ( with suffix ''ve'' such as fcyyyymmdd_hh+lllmd),  pressure and single level parameters for field verification and observation verification ( with suffix ''ve'' such as fcyyyymmdd_hh+lllve).

At the HIRLAM reference computer platform ECMWF, up till March 1, 2004, main results of a HIRLAM forecast cycle are archived into a tar file, ARyyyymmdd_hh.tar under ECFS. The files for verification (fc*ve) and the ascii file with verification results (ve*) , are collected into a second tar file, VEyyyymmdd_hh.tar. The lateral boundary files are stored into a third tar file, MFyyyymmdd_hh.tar, which is also archived. These files as well as other older archives can be found in ec:/rui/hirlam/RCRa

For the period after March 1 2004, the reference HIRLAM forecast as conducted operationally at FMI, RCRa, the data archives are maintained in untarred form in the ECMWF's ECFS at address 
   * ec:/rui/hirlam/RCRa/yyyy/mm/dd/hh    (March 1, 2004 - March 31, 2006) 
   * ec:/hirlam/RCRa/yyyy/mm/dd/hh         (April 1, 2006 -  )
