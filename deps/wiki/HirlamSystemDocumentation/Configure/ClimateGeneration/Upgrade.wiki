== Update of the DEM HDF-files in the HDFSETs "9000" and "regular" ==

This update of the data from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) fixes a minor bug in the height field, where the fill value has been corrected. The meteorological impact is estimated to be minimal.

The new HDF files for the DEM data include additional fields used to
aggregate parameters for the SSO parameterization. These are

{{{
  `sumheight_ss`
  `sumsqheight_ss`
  `maxslope_ss`
}}}


== New features included into the climate generation code ==

Features from the DMI version of the climate generation have been added to
the reference code, including aggregation of meso-scale sub-grid orography (MSO)
parameters for the Météo-France MSO parameterization scheme, as well as
small-scale sub-grid orography parameters (SSO) used for parameterization
of orographic turbulence in accordance with the MSO scheme.
The following list provides an overview over the major changes:

  * option to change the size of the aggregation grid, enabling to aggregate
    data on basis of a differnt grid scale. See the [wiki:CtopoUserGuide#goption ctopo user guide] for more information.
  * function to change the sample region from grid centre to a directional dependend
    sector: specific ctopo action "sample" (Caution: This feature is still in beta state)
    See the [wiki:CtopoUserGuide#sampleaction ctopo user guide] for more information.
  * processing of `z0_veg`
  * aggregation using a band-pass (Gaussian type)
  * MF-MSO parameters aggregation
  * SSO parameters aggregation

Additionally, some bug fixes have been applied, too:

  * proper determination of the domian edges when refining under a rotated grid
  * more stable mask addressing when identifying the aggregation mask grid
  * robust handling of round-off uncertainties during variance determination

The ctopo routine includes the following new actions, which are used in the MSO
processing:

  * dxdx, dydy
  * dxdy
  * bpfilter

Further details about using the updated ctopo routine can be found in the CtopoUserGuide.
The ctopo calls for processing both the MSO and the SSO parameters have been
included into the Climate script, and new configuration variables concrening
MSO parameter aggregation have been added into `Env_expdesc`:

||`MSO_BPF_HIGH` || MSO Band-Pass filter upper (small scale) limit in degrees||
||`MSO_BPF_LOW`  || MSO Band-Pass filter lower (large scale) limit in grid units||
||`MSO_PAR`      || switch on MSO parameterization in HIRLAM (MSO parameters are allways aggregated in the climate generation regardless of MSO_PAR)||

Note that MSO and SSO processing does not work for `HDFSET="old"`, because these HDF files do not contain the necessary data fields.



== Important Notes ==

The band-pass filtered height field, which is created when processing the MSO
parameters, is stored into a specifc HDF file called `hl_bpf_<HDFSET>_<HIRES>_<ext>_<slim>_<llim>_<ext>.hdf`,

  where
    `<HDFSET>`:: is the name of the underlying HDFSET
    `<HIRES>`::  is the resolution specification for HDFSET
    `<ext>`::    denotes the extension factor (filter approximation)
    `<slim>`::   is the small scale limit of the band-pass filter `MSO_BPF_HIGH` (in degrees)
    `<llim>`::   is the large scale limit of the band-pass filter `MSO_BPF_LOW` (in multiples of target grid mesh size)

----
The creation of the band-pass filtered height field is computationally expensive.
For example, processing for the RCR domain takes about 37 Minutes on the current
computer system at ECMWF.
In order to avoid excessive use of computer resources, the HDF file with the
band-pass filtered height is stored under `$HL_DATA/$EXP` and in the archive under `$HL_ARC/$EXP/ModelClimate`.
From there it will be restored when the experiment is rerun. However, as soon
the HDFSET or the filter characteristics (`MSO_BPF_HIGH`, `MSO_BPF_LOW`, filter approximation) are changed by the user, the band-pass filter has to create a new filtered field.

----
When using the `9000-0.0125` HDFSET and aggregating an area larger than what
is covered by the 0.0125° files, the data from `9000-0.025` are used. This
necessitates a gridrefinement procedure within ctopo, which may take
significant computer resources.
