== '''Overview''' ==
[[Center(end)]]
=== '''Status''' ===
 * 4D-VAR analysis code has been developed for over 10 years and has been part of the HIRLAM VAR system ever since
 * The script for running 4D-VAR analysis was introduced in 6.3.x. After many bug corrections on both source code and scripts, it is now targeted for 7.1
 * Evaluation of 4D-VAR indicates great potential to improve primarily on model skill to forecast high impact weather (strongly baroclinic, fast moving system) and the score improvements are to be seen mainly in quantities dominated by large scale characteristics: mslp, upper air wind, temperature and height
 * In the long run, 4D-VAR provides an improved framework for assimilating many new type of observations especially those with high temporal resolution and moist quantities
 * The current difficulty with 4D-VAR is the reproduction of major skill gain on other platform than the SMHI linux cluster
=== '''Main characteristics of 4D-VAR''' ===
 * '''What it does'''. Hirlam 4D-VAR is an upper air analysis scheme which updates surface pressure ps, horizontal wind components u/v, temperature t and specific humidity q at each analysis cycle, taking into account the model background information and observation data including the statistical error charctaeristics of both
 * '''Improved balance'''. Comparing to 3D-VAR, 4D-VAR minimization takes into account temporal changes of atmospheric motion. Although the final analysis is also relative to a single time point, (start of the assimilation window), the minimization involve time integration of tangent linear model version and its adjoint of the forecast model, thus the final analysis can be in better balance, so that model spin-up after analysis is normally less. Although 4D-VAR analysis is often associated with improved model forecasts, the analysis fit to observation at analysis time itself may be less good compared to 3D-VAR.
 * '''4D-VAR is very expensive'''. The need for time integration of the tangent linear and its adjoint of the forecast model makes the 4D-VAR algorithm computationally very expensive compared to 3D-VAR. The computational cost of a typical HIRLAM 4D-VAR analysis is equivalent to 1 to 3 times of the cost for running 48 h forecast
 * '''Advantage in implicit flow dependency'''. Use of forecast model in minimization brings implicit flow dependency, so that background error structure function is less dominating factor than in 3D-VAR
 * '''Advantage in use of data'''. 4D-VAR minimization is done along model trajectory, during which observation data are binned in small (hourly or more frequent) time slots to be compared to background values, therefore it has possibility to assimilate more observation data than 3DVAR. The latter is relative to a single time point assuming static model trajectory
 * '''Advantage in assimilation of cloud and precipitation information'''. It is not easy to find balance relationship for moist quantities. Due to use of forecast model, moist observation data has better chance to get assimilated which also has better chance to 'survive' in the following forecast
 * '''Asymmetric assimilation window'''. 4D-VAR allow assymetric assimilation window, which can be adjusted according to operational needs

=== '''Method''' ===
 * HIRLAM 4D-VAR is based on variational approach. It minimizes a cost function which is comprised of terms representing difference between model state and background (forecast of previous cycle), Jb, observation, Jo, and other constraint/penalty terms for differences between model state and DFI-filtered ones, Jc, the  model state from lateral boundary condition, Jlbc and the model state from large scale analysis, Jk. Currently only Jb, Jo and Jc are used. Jlbc is experimental and Jk is to be developed
 * Incremental method is applied in 4D-VAR, which means the minimization is done with reference to analysis increment, not the full analysis quantities.
 * HIRLAM-4DVAR uses spectral model version of the HIRLAM as code framework. The dynamic core of the tangent linear (TL) and adjoint (AD) model is derived from spectral HIRLAM
 * To reduce the cost in both development and computation, HIRLAM uses external (Meteo France), simplified physics in its TL and AD
 * Hirlam has two minimization options: M1QN3 or conjugate gradient. The former is default
 * Minimization can be performed using either single outerloop or multiple ones. The minimization process, mainly the time integration of TL and AD models, is performed in the so-called inner loop with typically reduced resolution in order to save computation cost. In the multi-incremental case, provisional 4D-VAR analysis is used to derive updated model trajectory to be used in terms other than Jb
 * The algorithm involving observation operator, quality control etc. is the same as in 3D-VAR, with the exception that use of smaller observation time slots now enable use of more data within same assimilation window.
 * Observation data screening (background check etc.) and variational quality control is used
 * Upon finishing of analysis, the 'analysis increment', which is valid at the start of 4D-VAR window, is projected forward to provide nominal hourly analysis for the rest of assimilation window, either through tangent linear (spectral) model integration at low resolution, or through nonlinear forward model integration (using grid point model). The former has been found to give better results
 
=== '''Implementation, data flow, i/o''' ===

== '''What's new in 7.1''' ==
[[Center(end)]]

 * Hirlam 7.1alpha1 contains a few corrections and two of them are critical:
   * Changeset that corrects error in option PROPAGATECONTROL
   * Changeset that corrects weak constraint Jc term
 * Hirlam 7.1alpha1 also modified baseline configuration for 4D-VAR, such as change of simplified physics scheme from BUIZZA to MFSP1 in TL and AD
 * Developers are recommended to base their experiments on source code versions with 7.0 or newer
 * For other purposes, it is generally not recommended to run 4D-VAR with code versions prior to 7.1alpha1

   1. In scripts/Env_expdesc the following baseline configuration of 4D-VAR has been choosen but users can explore alternative options:
{{{
     NOUTERLOOP=1           # number of outer loops. Choose 1 for single loop and 2 or 3 for multi-loops
     ILRES=3,2              # resolution decrease for consecutive inner loops relative to forecast model resolution
     OBSCUT=0230            # observation cutoff time in hhmm
     ILPHYS=MFSP1,MFSP2     # innerloop physics NONE,BUIZZA,MFSP1 (Meteo France simplified vertical diffusion),MFSP2 (MFSP1+simplified large scale condensation)
     SPNDTIME=1800,1800     # time step size for spectral TLM and ADM in consecutive loops
     NQLIMIT=80,30          # iteration limits for consecutive innerloops
     SPHALO=6,7             # halo zone width in number of grid point for consecutive loops
     NBZONE=6,7             # boundary relaxation zone width in inner loop
     JCDFI=yes              # yes to use weak constraint JcDFI, no to use strong constraint normal mode initialization in 4D-VAR minimization
     CONJUGATEG=no          # yes with Conjugate Gradient minimization (under development), else M1QN3 (default)
     LBCCONTROL=no          # yes to use lateral boundary control in 4D-VAR (under development)
     PROPAGATECONTROL=yes   # yes for projection of analysis increment with tangent linear model, no for using forecast model to derive nonminal analysis
