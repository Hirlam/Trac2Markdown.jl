== Input data ==

A HIRLAM forecast requires following input data:
 1. ASIMOF-grib formated, initial model state, (fort.14), normally an analysis, but it can also be an interpolated analysis or short range forecast of the host model, in the latter case it should be from previous cycle.
 1. ASIMOF-grib formated, interpolated lateral boundary data (containing ps, U, V, T, Q and orography) to the model grid. The time interval of such lateral boundary data are normally with a frequency of 1, 3 or 6 h, depending on availability, the more frequent, the better.
 1. ASIMOF-grib formated, first guess to the initial model state, fort.15, normally the short range forecast from the previous cycle but with update on surface states. This is needed with the incremental digital filtering scheme.
 1. a combined namelist sets assembled in a given sequence
 1. a file (fort.99) containing directory information about working directory

== Output data ==

A HIRLAM forecast generate two types of output:
 1. model history files, names as fc$yyyy$mm$dd_$hh+$lll, where $lll is the forecast length in hour. In principle a model history file contains a snapshot of the model state at a given time step and should contain all information needed to resume a forecast. The content in a model history file is not selectable.
 1. post-processed forecast output, normally names with the same file name as above but adding postfix 'md' or 've'. 'md' here refers to model diagnostics; 've' refers to selected surface or pressure level output for verification statistics purpose. The content of post-processed files can be freely chosen by namelist namppp as part of the namelist input. There is no restriction on which variables to output. The post-pp streams can also be made on a selected/reduced inner domain.
 1. time series files for pre-defined coordinates as specified in namtsf as part of the namelist input.
 1. In addition, the forecast model generate diagnosis/statistics at each time step domain averaged statistcis on the standard output file.
