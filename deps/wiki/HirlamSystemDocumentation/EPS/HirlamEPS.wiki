''' Hirlam ensemble prediction system ''' is under development as a part of
a multi-model system called: 

Grand Limited Area Ensemble Prediction System ''' GLAMEPS '''.

The scientific and methodological experimentation for the development of a real-time operational system takes place in a '' Laboratory Phase ''. Central in this phase is a special project
at ECMWF as a common platform in addition to resources at national met-services.
News about GLAMEPS Laboratory Phase can be found[https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/GLAMEPS_laboratory here].

GLAMEPS is a HIRLAM - ALADIN common project which will contribute to TIGGE. 
It is intended to share the distributed resources amongst members in fully operational mode in order to produce a scientifically based probabilistic forecasting system. System documentation of the real-time GLAMEPS will be published here when it becomes operational.
