HIRLAM-A Harmonie system training workshop is held on week 40, between Monday Sept 29 and Friday October 3 2008, at DMI, Copenhagen, Denmark. 

HIRLAM system experts and Harmonie pioneers who have been active in the development of the HARMONIE system are invited to give lectures. The main focus of the training week are
 1. HARMONIE system, with focus on operational, real time applications;
 1. HARMONIE surface and upper air data assimilation, including that of observation data handling (ODB etc.), background error statistics and monitoring;

The workshop takes place at the DMI meeting room NORDLYS, starts at 0915 Monday Sept 29 and finish at 1200 on Friday, Oct 3.

The purpose of the training week is to help participants to get acquainted with the fundamentals of the HARMONIE system features.
