Improved skill on using verification and validation tools available for HARMONIE development will most likely benefit both productivity and collaboration inside the HIRLAM-ALADIN community. As a consequence, the HIRLAM-C management has decided to arrange a training meeting with a focus on tools for verification and validation of HARMONIE. An impression of tools relevant for the meeting can be obtained from [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation#Verification Verification] under the [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation Harmonie System Documentation].
The training week will take place at
 
[[Center(begin)]]

''' '''[[BR]]
[[Center(end)]]


The program is expected to cover 4 days from Monday to Thursday 12-15 December, with an option of continued work on Friday for those interested. This choice is made to promote collaboration among staff on workshop related topics. Several meeting rooms are reserved for the event to provide maximum flexibility during the working days. 

It is assumed that participants already have some knowledge and skills on working with HARMONIE related topics on a Laptop or on HPCs. However, the emphasis is on tools for monitoring, verification and validation and NOT on running the complete HARMONIE system which will be a likely topic of a training in 2017. It is expected that participants bring their own laptop to the working week. DMI will make internet access available to all and try to accommodate wishes from the lecturers and participants, linked to satisfactory experimental conditions necessary for various training exercises.

Lectures in the morning will be followed by training during the rest of the day. The meeting starts on Monday 12 December at 9.00. When you arrive 
to DMI go to the reception and you will be guided to the Auditorium where the lectures are given during the morning hours. The daily meetings can extend beyond the normal office hours (9-17) if needed.
