== Basics about wiki page editing ==
 * [HirlamHowto/Systemwiki/AccessContribution Access and Contribution to HIRLAM system wiki]
 * Basic wiki editing features:
    * Look at existing wiki pages and use 'edit this page' button!
    * titles, paragraphs, colors, imagies, links,
 * [[Color(red, Who has touched my wiki page)]]? You may sometimes see that the wiki page you authored has been changed. Who did that? Sometimes it occurs that two persons editing the same page at the same time, and the one that submit his changes had to redo things. 
  * From any of the system wiki, you may click on 'Timeline' to see who has last made changes to system wiki and to the system repository. Click on the 'diff' button to inspect changes.
  * All wiki pages has a [wiki:HarmonieSystemTraining2008/Lecture/WikiAuthoring?action=diff&version=2 Last Change] button. Click on that and eventually further on [wiki:HarmonieSystemTraining2008/Lecture/WikiAuthoring?action=history page history] and [wiki:HarmonieSystemTraining2008/Lecture/WikiAuthoring?action=diff&version=1 previous changes] to see the page history.
