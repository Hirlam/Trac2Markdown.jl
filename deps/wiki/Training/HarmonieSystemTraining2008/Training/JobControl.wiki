== Instructions or links to instructions ==
== Practice tasks ==
 * Introduce [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/trunk/hirlam/scripts/CollectLogs.pl CollectLogs.pl] (from the Hirlam repository) into the Harmonie system.
 * Start mini-SMS with e.g. DEBUG=6 and watch the file harmonie.db
 * Write a climate.tdf to get all 12 climate files
 * Introduce a "Listener" to process files fairly soon after creation rather than wait for the forecast to finish
 * To play with mini-SMS (suite, families, tasks, triggers, counters, loops, etc., or the mini-SMS interface), start from the attached file (trial.tar.gz). Unpack it in a working directory, and put . in your path. Run "perl mSMS.pl --prepare --play --halted suite". At ECMWF, use /usr/local/bin/perl56. Note that mini-SMS will start in the state defined by the checkpoint file suite.check. If you want to start mini-SMS from fresh, remove the file suite.check before you start mini-SMS.
