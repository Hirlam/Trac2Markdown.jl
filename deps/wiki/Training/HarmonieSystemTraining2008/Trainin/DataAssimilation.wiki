'How to Derive Background error statistics for HARMONIE Data assimilation'

1a. Design your area (or use a pre-defined one) and run one day of up to 36 h forecasts (00,12 UTC).

1b. Create an executable for calculating forecast differences.

1c. Run makediff script to generate one file with forecast differences.


2. Carry out one cycle of data assimilation on the Scandinavian domain.


3. Generalize the HARMONIE 3D-Var background error constraint to include interpolation, extrapolation of structure functions         (very difficult, for Ole (-;)
 

4. Generate structure functions, based on at least one month of forecast differences, utilizing festat (extensive, to bring home).

'A POSTERIORI DIAGNOSIS OF BACKGROUND ERROR STATISTICS FOR 

HARMONIE DATA ASSIMILATION'

1a. Create a single-observation experiment on existing Scandinavian area. 

1b. Plot analysis minus first guess for single observation experiment.


2a. Create a full scale assimilation cycle for existing Scandinavian area.

2b. Plot analysis minus first guess for full scale data assimilation experiment.


3 Bring /ms_perm/alas/magnus/Stat_demo.tar.gz to your laptop and visualize the different diagnostical files, using your own plotting software.
