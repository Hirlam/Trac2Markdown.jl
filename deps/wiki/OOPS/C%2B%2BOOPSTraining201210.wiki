 * Thursday
   Preliminary content of the Thursday OOPS lectures
   * [
   * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/OOPS/C%2B%2BOOPSTraining201210/oops_intro_nils.pdf Background of the OOPS design] NG
   * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/OOPS/C%2B%2BOOPSTraining201210/slides_daan.pdf Definition of field sets and state. LAM features in OOPS] DD
   * LAM in the QG  OOPS NG
     * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/OOPS/C%2B%2BOOPSTraining201210/changeset_LAM.tar.gz Code updates to run LAM qg]

   * Design tasks and discussion points
    * Treatment of lateral boundaries in models/ and control of lateral boundaries in
     data assimilation.
     Motivation: The lateral boundaries is what makes a LAM different from the global model.
    * How to go from global to LAM or LAM/LAM geometries
      Motivation: Interpolation between different geometries is an important part of a LAM setup. How can we see that this can be handled within OOPS (probably on a level below, or as a separate task that calls a change geometry function in State)
    * Background errors in the qg model
      Motivation: Here we also need to consider the LAM geometry and also apply an extension zone.
    * Control of the large scale ( JK ) in DA and spectral nudging in mdels
      Motivation: Should the large scale fields be a separate auxiliary information in State or the same as the LBC fields?
    * Ensembles in OOPS
      Motivation: Ensemble methods are today an integrated part of the DA system. How can we construct OOPS in an optimal way to be able to handle this. On one hand an ensemble can be considered as information for the background error covariance. On the other hand we also want to do assimilation separately for each ensemble member. Shall we talk about a state of ensemble members or an ensemble of member states?
 
 * Friday 09.00

== Preparation and documentation ==

 A number of documents have been uploaded to this page and are meant to serve as preparatory and working material for the training.

 * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/OOPS/C%2B%2BOOPSTraining201210/OOPSdesign.pdf OOPS design]
 * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/OOPS/C%2B%2BOOPSTraining201210/TC_oops.pdf Basic technical instructions]
 * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/OOPS/C%2B%2BOOPSTraining201210/Traits.pdf Model traits interfaces]
 * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/OOPS/C%2B%2BOOPSTraining201210/OOPSforReview.tar.gz The OOPS code]

 A good exercise is to download the source code, try to build it locally and run the example described in the technical instructions.
