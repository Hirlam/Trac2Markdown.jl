== Comments ==

 * For the physiography exercise on page 1 of the pdf you need to download the physiography data as described under [wiki:NordicSurfexCourse2013#Preparations Preparations for practical exercises]. If you copy your version of links.sh to any of the stage_surfex/pgd/xxx directories and execute it all data you need will be available.
 * I haven't succeeded to get the trpixel.bash script to work... but here is one [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/NordicSurfexCourse2013/ToulouseCourse/load_plot_PGD_data.py  ipython --pylab script] and one [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/NordicSurfexCourse2013/ToulouseCourse/load_plot_PGD_data.m  MATLAB script] that are coded for the spitzberg case.
