 * The first practical exercises will make use of the pre-defined experiments.
 * To set up one or more of these experiments please refer to the "How to install a pre-defined experiment" in the [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/surfex/IMG/pdf/surf-v7-3.pdf SURFEX 7.3 User's guide] or visit the [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/surfex-lab SURFEX-lab] page and go to "Documentation" --> "User's guide". Follow the instructions under "1.2. Export off-line version of SURFEX (from version 7_2)".

Copy all contents to your SURFEX working directory and run pgd, prep and offline consequently. Should work but I have no idea what is in the input or in results, please find out!
