EXERCISE 1:

Create forcing from TESTBED-grib from TESTBED for Norrk√∏ping files using the attached create_forcing version (Linux only)

----

EXERCISE 2:

Create forcing for the full testbed domain with the input files from above. Use netCDF forcing and output format and look on the results with ncview

----

EXERCISE 3:

Create a new routine called my_forc_[your-name].F90. Modify my_forcing.F90 accordingly.

Insert you own values for the needed output-values, and see if you get offline SURFEX to run.

----

EXERCISE 4 (advanced):

* First install a new instance of EXPORT_r1341 in a new directory

* Get SODA patch from:
https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/NordicSurfexCourse2013/soda.tar

* Untar the patch in EXPORT_r1341

{{{
cd src

#Modify environment and Makefile if needed

./configure

# source config-fil
make
make installmaster

export XYZ=""
export SRC_SURFEX=""
export VER_USER=FORC

./configure

# source the new config file
make user
make installuser
}}}

The basic installation installs without fimex/gl support.

There is a script MY_RUN/FORCING/figl.sh which demonstrates the use fimex/netcdf files. Basically it links the input-files and run:
{{{
cd ../MY_RUN/FORCING
./prepare_forcing.bash figl
}}}

with namelists: "namelist" and possibly "naminterp" in addition to the needed MY_SRC/NAMELIST/MY_PARAM.nam and MY_SRC/NAMELIST/OPTIONS.nam
