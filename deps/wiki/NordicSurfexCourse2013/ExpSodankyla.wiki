== Sodankyl채 observations ==

In this exercise we use observations from the [http://fmiarc.fmi.fi/index.php The Arctic Research Centre of Finnish Meteorological Institute] in Sodankyl채, northern Finland. The available observations are described at this [http://litdb.fmi.fi/ page]. Please note that forcing data and evaluation data are collected from different places at the Sodankyl채 research area. For example, the air temperature, air humidity and wind in the forcing data is from the mast in the forest at height 18 m above ground (where the trees are 12.5 m tall). The radiation data is from the radiation measurement site a few 100 meters away and snow depth data is collected at yet another place nearby which can be described as a clearing in the forest area. Thus, snow depth data does not necessarily represent snow depth in the forest beneath the trees. So, keep this in mind when you compare model output and observations. I have realized that the precipitation in the end of 2009 is strange so don't care about last winter performance.

== Forcing data ==

You can download forcing data (Forc_*.txt), configuration file (Params_config.txt) and namelist file (OPTIONS.nam) [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/NordicSurfexCourse2013/ExpSodankyla/Sodankyla_forcing.tgz here]. Unpack this file in a new directory in which you will run SURFEX. In this directory you must also define links to the ECOCLIMAP cover parameters files:

{{{ln -s xxx/MY_RUN/ECOCLIMAP/ecoclimapI_covers_param.bin ecoclimapI_covers_param.bin}}}

{{{ln -s xxx/MY_RUN/ECOCLIMAP/ecoclimapII_eu_covers_param.bin ecoclimapII_eu_covers_param.bin}}}

where xxx is the path to your SURFEX code directory.

--------------------------------------

== Evaluation data ==

You can download evaluation data [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/NordicSurfexCourse2013/ExpSodankyla/Eval_data_Sodankyla.tgz here]. Unpack this file e.g. in the same directory as where you have forcing data. The tgz-file includes an ASCII file with data and a text file which describes what the columns are.

--------------------------------------

== MATLAB scripts for reading and visualization of data ==

 [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/NordicSurfexCourse2013/ExpSodankyla/matlab_scripts.tgz Here] you can download one script for reading of SURFEX ASCII output and one script for plotting of results. You also need these [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/NordicSurfexCourse2013/ExpSodankyla/additional_matlab_scripts.tgz additional scripts]! The idea with these scripts is that you have at least two simulations that you wish to compare.

--------------------------------------

== Test examples ==

Here are a few examples that one can look into:

* How sensitive are the results for initial conditions in soil temperature and humidity (i.e. namelist NAM_PREP_ISBA) and in snow (i.e. namelist NAM_PREP_ISBA_SNOW)?
* Does comparison with observed heat fluxes (H and LE) improve/degrade due to changes in namelist NAM_ISBA (e.g. LAI, Z0, ROOTFRAC)?
* How sensitive are the results for snow albedo parameters in namelist NAM_SURF_CSTS (e.g. XANSMIN, XANSMAX)?
