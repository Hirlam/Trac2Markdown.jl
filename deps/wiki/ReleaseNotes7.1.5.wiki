== Highlights of 7.1.5 ==

Hirlam 7.1.5 is a bug correction release over the Hirlam reference system, [wiki:Hirlam_7.1].4, which switches the default computer platform at ECMWF HPC from HPCE to C1A. In addition, it ports several system updates and bug corrections recently installed in later HIRLAM versions (Hirlam-7.2, Hirlam 7.3). 7.1.5 also includes use of HARMONIE observation verification procedure for convenience of verification inter-comparison against other HIRLAM/HARMONIE experiments performed with later HIRLAM versions.

Overall the meteorological impact of the update is estimated to be minor, which is limited primarily to the correction about lateral boundary data interpolation [6737].

The complete source code of Hirlam 7.1.5 can be obtained by using either

 * Subversion command
{{{
   svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/hirlam-7.1.5
}}}
 * or source code tarball, available from ECMWF ecgate:/scratch/ms/dk/nhz/hirlam-7.1.5.tar.gz or ecfs:/hirlam/src/tar/hirlam-7.1.5.tar.gz which contains the sandbox (check-out version) of the Hirlam 7.1.5

== Updates in 7.1.5 ==
  1. introduction of the new default dual-hosts platform at ECMWF [6862],[6865];
  1. bug correction about surface pressure correction/interpolation [6737];
  1. correction about observation handling at ECMWF platform [6732];
  1. inclusion of HARMONIE GL for enhanced observation verification [5955];
  1. script improvement for mini-SMS script robustness in LSMIX scenario [5765];
  1. minor correction for re-forecast scenario [5766]. 

== How to run Hirlam 7.1.5 ==

On ECMWF, the reference setting assumes dual platform ecgate-c1a. To set up and initiate experiments using 7.1.5, do, e.g.,
{{{
   mkdir $HOME/hl_home/test715; cd $HOME/hl_home/test715
   ~nhz/Hirlam setup -r 7.1.5
   --- some additional configuration settings ---
   ~nhz/Hirlam start DTG=2008101000 DTGEND=2008101006
}}}
