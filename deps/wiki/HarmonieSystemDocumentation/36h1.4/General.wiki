=== Get the Harmonie source ===

To obtain the HARMONIE source, assuming the computer platform has svn client available, one may check out from the repository at the host hirlam.org:
{{{
        svn export  https://svn.hirlam.org/branches/harmonie-36h1.4         # for the recently tagged (stable-) HARMONIE system
        svn export https://svn.hirlam.org/trunk/harmonie                    # for the latest updated (unstable-) version
}}}
For Harmonie build using miniSMS script, it suffices that you have access to the HARMONIE system source:
{{{
 ecgate:/home/ms/spsehlam/hlam/harmonie_release/36h1.4
}}}
One may also get a HARMONIE source code tarball, e.g., from ECMWF computer, 
{{{
        ecgate:    /scratch/ms/spsehlam/hlam/harmonie-36h1.4.tar.gz        # for the recently tagged (stable-) HARMONIE system
        ecfs:      ec:/hirlam/src/tar/harmonie-36h1.4.tar.gz
}}}

=== Compiler version ===

If you are using the [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GNU compiler system], make sure you have '''gfortran 4.3''' or higher. [[BR]]
Latest GCC compiler releases are available here: [http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html GCC Releases][[BR]]

You can find a binary for a 32 bit Intel Linux system at [http://quatramaran.ens.fr/~coudert/gfortran/gfortran-i686-linux.tar.bz2], (This link above is broken I think).[[BR]]

The installation instructions are at [http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries32Linux].

=== BLAS and LAPACK libraries ===

You need [http://netlib.org/ BLAS and LAPACK-lite] libraries.

If they are already on your system, verify they have been made with the correct compiler, or rebuild them. Instructions on how to (re-)build BLAS and LAPACK follow below:
 * Download [http://www.netlib.org/blas/index.html BLAS] and [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html LAPACK]
 * First build BLAS (untarring blas.tgz places it in the BLAS directory). Go to that directory, and edit make.inc to set the compiler and linker to '''gfortran'''. Then type 'make'.
 * Subsequenty, for LAPACK, after untarring lapack-lite-3.1.1.tgz, go to the lapack-lite-3.1.1 directory.
 * Copy make.inc.example to make.inc.
 * Edit make.inc to point to the proper compiler/loader ('''gfortran''') and to put the variable PLAT to the empty string. Set TIMER to INT_ETIME.
 * Copy the blas.a library from the BLAS directory to the lapack-lite-3.1.1 directory, run ranlib on it, then type 'make'.
 * Then copy the libraries in '''/usr/local/lib''' with names libblas.a and liblapack.a, respectively, otherwise the default configuration will not find them. Run ranlib on them.

=== GRIB API software ===

The GRIB API library is required for '''gl''' from 36h1.4. The latest version of GRIB-API is available here: [http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/download/grib_api.html]

GRIB API should be built with the same compiler as you are using for the Harmonie system (eg '''gfortran 4.3''' or higher if you are using the GNU compiler system).

=== Auxiliary libraries (now part of Harmonie system) ===
'''The following instructions are not applicable to Harmonie 36h1.1 and later'''.[[BR]]

Next you need some auxiliary libraries, provided by ECMWF and Meteo France. The libraries contain GRIB and BUFR software as well as dummies for routines available only at ECMWF. They can be found on ECFS at ECMWF under:
{{{
ecfs :/rme/hirald/install/auxlibs_installer.1.3.tar.gz
}}}


They will untar in the directory auxlibs_installer.1.3. There you'll find the following directories:
 * bufr_000350
 * dummies_001
 * eclite_001
 * gribex_000350
 * rgb_001

In each of these directories, run the script ./build_library.  You'll have to answer the following
questions:

 * Which compiler to use
 * Whether you want 64 bit reals (yes)
 * Where to store the library on completion of the build (choose a subdirectory of your home directory
   where you have write permission - note: full path; e.g. the GFORTRAN.LINUX configuration assumes these
   libraries are in $HOME/auxlibs and include files in $HOME/auxinclude)

After build_library finishes, run ./install - this will put the library in the directory you've chosen above.

=== Perl requirements ===
To be able to launch the mSMS mXdcp window you need to have perl toolkit installed. Define PERL_TK and PERLTKDIR in your system config file, read more below.


=== Preparation of source codes for HARMONIE system on ecgate ===

 * Make sure you belong to the hirald group at ECMWF platform. Write to Claude Fisher at Meteo France (for ALADIN users) and Ulf Andrae (ulf.andrae@smhi.se, for HIRLAM users) requesting it if you do not.
 * Due to limitation of the ECMWF HPCF currently preparation and compilation of the HARMONIE-related software need to be done using ecgate and HPCE platforms, separately. For retrieving of the HARMONIE source code/updates (from https://svn.hirlam.org) using Subversion (svn) command, it needs to be done at ecgate platform. The compilation and experiment submission are then done at HPCE platform. 
   * Log in to ecgate platform. Subversion is installed at ecgate but you have to edit the server configuration file for subversion to be able to access hirlam.org. 
{{{  
Change in $HOME/.subversion/servers
from
# http-proxy-exceptions = *.exception.com, www.internal-site.org
to
  http-proxy-exceptions = *.ecmwf.int, localhost
  http-proxy-host = www-gw.ecmwf.int
  http-proxy-port = 3333
}}}
   * If $HOME/.subversion/servers does not exist, use the copy of ''servers'' attached to this page.
   * All subversion commands has to be done on ECGATE, even if you install the code on HPCE.
