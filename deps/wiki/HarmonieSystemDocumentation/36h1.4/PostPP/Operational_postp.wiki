== Operational postprocessing ==

HARMONIE is run as both a research model and an operational weather forecast model. Demands are different depending on the users, and operational_postp is a switch found in [source:tags/harmonie-36h1.4/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h] to turn start postprocessing as soon as a file is written on disk. For an operational service this is important, although, more resources are used simultanously. This is activated by setting:

operational_postp="yes"

When you want all the postprocessing to wait until the complete forecast is finished, you should set:

operational_postp="no"
