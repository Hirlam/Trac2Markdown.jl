== Introduction ==

Before we can run the verification we need to extract data for each geographical point and produce files in a format that the verification program can use. In HARMONIE there are two programs, one fore extracting model data (fldextr) and one for observations ( obsextr ). Both are part of the [source:tags/harmonie-36h1.4/util/gl gl package]. 

  fldextr is capable of extracting data from several sources (HARMONIE/HIRLAM/IFS and produces so called vfld-files in ASCII format. The main tasks of the program is to:

   - Recalculates rh,td to be over water
   - Interpolates to geographical points according to a synop.list and temp.list
   - Does MSLP,RH2M,TD2M calculations if the are not available in the input file
   - Optional fraction of land check.
   - Interpolates to pressure levels for TEMP data.

  obsextr extracts conventional observations from BUFR data and creates a vobs file similar to the vfld file. It:

   - Reads SYNOP and TEMP
   - LUSE_LIST controls the usage of a station list


== Field extraction ==

[source:tags/harmonie-36h1.4/scr/Run_fldver Run_fldver]. This script goes through all forecast files and 
collects all the variables (T2m, V10m, mean sea level pressure, RH2m, Q2m, total cloudiness, precipitation + profiles) 
needed in basic verification.

 * Input parameters: none.
 * Data: Forecast files.
 * Namelists: Station lists for surface data (ewglam.list) and radiosounding data (temp.list).
 * Executables: fldextr.
 * Output: Field extraction files (vfld${EXP}${DTG}), which are placed in ''EXTRARCH''.

== Extract observations ==

[source:tags/harmonie-36h1.4/scr/FetchOBS FetchOBS] scripts takes care of the observation 
extraction for verification. First, the observation BUFR-file is fetched from the MARS ('''ExtractVEROBSfromMARS'''), 
then all the needed data is extracted from the BUFR-files.

 * Input parameters: none.  
 * Data:  Station lists for surface data (ewglam.list) and radiosounding data (temp.list). These shoud be found from ''SCRDIR''  
 * Executables: mars, obsextr.  
 * Output: Field extraction files (vobs*), which are placed in ''EXTRARCH''.
