== Introduction ==
This wiki page summaries the ARPEGE/IFS source code made available in the HARMONIE system. It is based on documents made available by YESSAD K. (METEO-FRANCE/CNRM/GMAP/ALGO). The relevant document for cycle 40 is available here: [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc//spip.php?article171 http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc//spip.php?article171] (or directly here: [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc//IMG/pdf/ykarchi40t1.pdf http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc//IMG/pdf/ykarchi40t1.pdf]). Documents for other versions are available in the [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/40h1.1/Source#Referencesanddocumentation "References and documentation" section]. This page used the 40T1 document.

== HARMONIE Source Library Structure ==
The main source of HARMONIE system originates from IFS/ARPEGE and it consists of a number of "project" sources. These are:
   * aeolus: Aeolous source code, a package for pre-processing satellite lidar wind data. '''Inactive for us'''.
   * aladin: specific routines only relevant to LAM, (limited area models, in particular ALADIN and AROME).

   * arpifs: global model routines (ARPEGE, IFS), and routines common to global and LAM models. This is the core of the ARPEGE/IFS software. The core of ARPEGE/IFS software.
   * biper: Biperiodization routines for the LAM
