== Overview ==

Harmonie is HIRLAM's adaptation of the LAM version of the IFS/ARPEGE project. The common code shared with the ALADIN program, Meteo France and ECMWF only contains the source code. Harmonie adds the build environment, scripts, a scheduler, and a number of diagnostics tools for file conversion and postprocessing. In summary a download of harmonie from the repository, [https://svn.hirlam.org] contains the following main directories

 * config-sh : Configuration and job submission files for different platforms.
 * const : A selected number of constant files for bias correction, assimilation and different internal schemes. A large number of date for climate generation and the RTTOV software is kept outside of the repository. See [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation#Downloaddata].
 * ecf : header files for ECFLOW
 * msms Scripts and suit definition files for mSMS, the scheduler for HARMONIE. 
 * nam : Namelists for different configurations.
 * scr : Scripts to run the different tasks.
 * sms : Directory for the main configuration file [source:tags/harmonie-40h1.1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h] and the sms scripts ( or containers ) for msMS.
