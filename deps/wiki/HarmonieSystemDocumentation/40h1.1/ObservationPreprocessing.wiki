It is worth to mention some differences between the observation pre-processing systems used by ECMWF/IFS (IFS), Météo France (MF),HARMONIE, and HIRLAM. Some of these differences are listed below:
||                          || Météo France                                 || IFS                                       || HARMONIE                                     || HIRLAM                           ||
|| data format/content      || BUFR, but sometimes with own table           || BUFR with WMO code                        || BUFR with WMO code                           || BUFR with WMO code               ||
|| creation of ODB database || two steps using oulan and bator              || one step, use of complex package bufr2odb || two steps using oulan and bator              || no ODB for HIRLAM                ||
|| blacklisting technique   || during the creation of the ODB and screening || (may be) only during screening            || during the creation of the ODB and screening || blacklist files read by hirvda.x ||
