== Introduction ==

There are several levels on configuration available in HARMONIE. The highest level of configuration is done in [source:tags/harmonie-40h1.1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h]. It includes the environment variables, which are used to control the experimentation. In the following we describe the meaning of the different variables and are described in the order they appear in [source:tags/harmonie-40h1.1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h].

Host specific paths and environment variables for your system are defined in Env_system. Read more [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/40h1.1/Installation here].

== Build options ==

BUILD=${BUILD-yes}                     # Turn on or off the compilation and binary build ( yes|no)
}}}
''BUILD'' is a switch for compiling HARMONIE code (__yes__|no). The

There are currently two ways of building the code. The choice is done through the environment variable ''MAKEUP'' in the [source:tags/harmonie-40h1.1/config-sh/config.ecgb-cca config file] for your particular system. The ALADIN style [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?page=recherche&recherche=gmkpack gmkpack] or the more make like system [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/40h1.1/Build_with_makeup Makeup]. For makeup there are no explicit settings to be done in the experiment configuration. For gmkpack however there are some options:
 * ''REVISION'' is the revision ( or cycle ) number, has to be set even for the trunk!
 * ''BRANCH'' sets the rootpack branch
 * ''VERSION'' is the version of revision/branch to use
 * ''OPTION'' sets which gmkpack/arch/SYSTEM.HOST.OPTION file to use
 * ''OTHER_PROGRAMS'' are other optional programs to be compiled with gmkpack
 * ''BUILD_ROOTPACK'' Switch for building the rootpack when running HARMONIE install. Can be useful to turn off for debugging. (__yes__|no).

In the general config file for your system, like [source:tags/harmonie-40h1.1/config-sh/config.ecgb-cca config.ecgb-cca] the path to the rootpack of gmkpack is defined as ROOTPACK.

{{{
BINDIR=${BINDIR-$HM_DATA/bin}                 # Binary directory
}}}
''BINDIR'' is the location of where your HARMONIE binaries will be installed. You can use this to point to binaries outside of your experiment.

== General settings ==
{{{
# **** Misc, defined first because it's used later ****

CNMEXP=HARM                             # Four character experiment identifier
WRK=$HM_DATA/$CYCLEDIR                  # Work directory
}}}
 * ''CNEXP'': experiment identifier used by MASTERODB
 * ''WRK'' is the work directory. The suggested path on cca is $SCRATCH/hm_home/${EXP}/$CYCLEDIR

== Archive settings (ECMWF) ==
Since $SCRATCH is cleaned regularly on cca and ecgb some files are transferred to ECFS for a more permanent storage by the scripts [source:tags/harmonie-40h1.1/scr/Archive_host1 Archive_host1] and [source:tags/harmonie-40h1.1/scr/Archive_ecgb Archive_ecgb]. 
{{{
# **** Paths to archive ****
# We need to define ARCHIVE early since it might be used further down

                                        # minimum: only logs and vfld file
                                        # medium: main results

EXTRARCH=$ARCHIVE_ROOT/extract          # Archive for fld/obs-extractions
}}}
 * ''ARSTRATEGY'' Archiving strategy according to the following levels:
      * minimum: only logs and vfld file
      * __medium__: main results. All files needed to continue your experiment from data on ECFS.
      * maximum: everything
 * ''ARCHIVE_ROOT'' is the path to forecast file archive. '''Note that at ECMWF this directory is not a permanent storage'''
 * ''EXTRARCH'' is the path to field extraction archive. '''Note that at ECMWF this directory is not a permanent storage'''
 * ''ECFSLOC'' Archiving site at ECMWF-ECFS  (__ectmp__|ec) '''Note that files archived on ectmp will be lost after 90 days.''' If you wish your files to stay longer you should set ECFSLOC=ec. 
 * ''ECFSGROUP'' Group in which to chgrp the ECMWF archive, (__hirald__|default)

== Running Mode ==
{{{
# **** Running mode ****
RUNNING_MODE=research                   # Research or operational mode (research|operational)
                                        # operational implies that

SIMULATION_TYPE=nwp                     # Type of simulation (nwp|climate)
}}}
 * ''RUNNING_MODE'' can be __research__ or operational. Operational is more forgiving in the error handling and e.g. the assimilation will be skipped if Bator doesn't find any observations. Exceptions handled by the operational mode are written to {{{$HM_DATA/severe_warnings.txt}}}
 * ''SIMULATION_TYPE'' Switch between __nwp__ and climate type of simulation. The climate simulations are still in an experimental stage. [wiki:HarmonieClimate/HCLIM40 See HARMONIE-Climate for cy40h for more information]

The writeup times of model output can be defined as a space separated list or as a fixed frequency for model history files, surfex files and postprocessed files respectively. The unit of the steps of WRITUPTIMES, SWRITUPTIMES, PWRITUPTIMES and OUTINT should be in hours or minutes depending on the '''TFLAG''' Regular output interval can be switched on by setting OUTINT>0. Consequently, OUTINT will override the WRITUPTIMES lists!

 * ''TFLAG'': Time flag for model output. Hourly or minute-based output (__h__|min)
 * ''HWRITUPTIMES'':  Output list for history files. Default is "00-21:3,24-60:6" which will output files every 3 hours for 00-21 and every 6 hours for 24-60.
 * ''VERITIMES'':  Output list for verification files. Default is "00-60:1" which will produce file every 1 hour for 00-60
 * ''SWRITUPTIMES''  Output list for surfex files. Default is "00-06:3" which output a  SURFEX file every 3 hours for 00-06.
 * ''PWRITUPTIMES''  Output list for fullpos (post-processed) files. Default is "00-21:3,24-60:6" which will output files every 3 hours for 00-21 and every 6 hours for 24-60.
 * ''SURFEX_OUTPUT_FORMAT'': Output format for surfex (__fa__|lfi)
 * ''SURFEX_LSELECT'': Switch to write a selection of fields in SURFEX output files (__yes__|no). (Only tested with SURFEX_OUTPUT_FORMAT=fa). [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/40h1.1/Namelists#surfex_selected_output.pm See surfex_selected_output.pm for more info.]
 * ''SURFEX_DUMP_STATE_STEPS'': Output steps for which we dump the full SURFEX model state if SURFEX_LSELECT=yes. [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/40h1.1/Namelists#surfex_selected_output.pm See surfex_selected_output.pm for more info.]
 * ''INT_SINI_FILE'': name and location of the initial SURFEX file
 * ''ARCHIVE_ECMWF'': archive files to ECFSLOC at ECMWF (__yes__|no)
 * ''IO_SERVER'': Use IO server (yes|__no__). If set to "yes" changes may be required in Env_submit -> config-sh/submit.YOURHOUST
 * ''POSTP'': Postprocessing by Fullpos (__inline__|offline|none).
 * ''FREQ_RESET'': Reset frequency of max/min values in hours, controls NRAZTS. Default is every 3 hours

More options on fullpos postprocessing can be found in [browser:trunk/harmonie/scr/Select_posp.pl Select_postp.pl]

 * ''CONVERTFA'': Conversion of FA files to GRIB or NetCDF (yes|__no__)
 * ''ARCHIVE_FORMAT'': Format of archive files (__grib__|nc). NetCDF format yet only available in climate mode
 * ''RCR_POSTP'' Produce a subset of fields from the history file for RCR monitoring (yes|__no__). This is only applicable if MAKEGRIB=yes
