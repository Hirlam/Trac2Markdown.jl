== Introduction ==

 The HARMONIE system reads and writes a number of different formats. 

== FA files ==

 Default internal format input/output for HARMONIE for gridpoint, spectral and SURFEX data. GRIB is used as a way to pack data, but the grib record cannot be used as such.

 * The header contains information about model domain, projection, spectral truncation, extension zone, boundary zone, vertical levels. 
 * Only one date/time per file.
 * FA routines are found under ifsaux/fa
 * List or convert a file with [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/PostPP/gl_grib_api gl_grib_api]
 * Other listing tool [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?page=recherche&recherche=PINUTS PINUTS]

== GRIB/GRIB2 ==

 All FA files may be converted to GRIB after the forecast run. For the conversion between FA names and GRIB parameters check [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/Forecast/Outputlist/43h2 this table].

 * List or convert a GRIB file with [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/PostPP/gl_grib_api gl_grib_api]

== NETCDF ==

 In climate mode all FA files may converted to NETCDF after the forecast run. For the conversion between FA names and NETCDF parameters check [source:Harmonie/util/gl_grib_api/inc/nc_tab.h?rev=release-43h2.beta.3 this table].

 * For the manipulation and listing of NETCDF files we refer to standard NETCDF tools.
 * NETCDF is also used as output data from some SURFEX tools.

== BUFR and ODB ==

 BUFR is the archiving/exchange format for observations. Observation Database is used for efficient handling of observations on IFS. ODB used for both input data and feedback information.

 Read more about observations in HARMONIE [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/UseofObservation here].

== DDH (LFA files ) ==

 Diagnostics by Horizontal Domains allows you to accumulate fluxes from different packages over different areas/points. 
 
 * LFA files ( Autodocumented File Software )
 * [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article44&var_recherche=LFA&var_lang=en gmapdoc]
 * under util/ddh

== Misc ==
 
 * vfld/vobs files in a simple ASCII format used by the [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/PostPP/Verification verification].
 * Obsmon files are stored in sqlite format.
