= File conversion =

ALADIN and AROME works with FA and LFI files. The file formats are described on the GMAP documentation site

http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/recherche.php3?recherche=FA+LFI

Since we are used to work with GRIB it's convenient to convert the FA/LFI files to GRIB. This is described in

[source:Harmonie/util/gl/README?rev=release-43h2.beta.3 README]

It's worth to mention that the conversion from FA/LFI names to GRIB parameters is at the moment a most subjective choice an by no means any standard. 


= Postprocessing =

There is an extensive postprocessing tool in ALADIN, fullpos

http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/article.php3?id_article=17&var_recherche=fullpos

There is no working postprocessing yet in this release, but it will be added as soon as possible


= Verification =

The verification an extension of the verification used in the developement of HIRVDA. When running an experiment at ECMWF files that can be used for verification will be produced both from the model and the observations.
