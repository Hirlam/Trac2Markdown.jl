== Introduction ==

 The HARMONIE system reads and writes a number of different formats. 

== FA files ==

 Internal format input/output for HARMONIE for gridpoint or spectral data. GRIB is used as a way to pack data, but the grib record cannot be used as such.

 * The header contains information about model domain, projection, spectral truncation, extension zone, boundary zone, vertical levels. 
 * Only one date/time per file.
 * FA routines are found under xrd/fa
 * List or convert a file with [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/37h1.2/PostPP/gl gl]
 * Other listing tool [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?page=recherche&recherche=PINUTS PINUTS] ( not built in HARMONIE by default )

 [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?page=recherche&recherche=FA+ Read more ]

== LFI files ==

 File format for SURFEX model input and output data
 
 * LFI routines for handling direct-access files under xrd/lfi
 * List and convert a file with [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/37h1.2/PostPP/gl gl]

 [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?page=recherche&recherche=LFI Read more]
 
== GRIB/GRIB2 ==

 All FA and lfi files are converted to GRIB after the forecast run. For the conversion between FA/lfi names and GRIB parameters check [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/37h1.2/Forecast/Outputlist/37h1 this table].

 * Through the introduction of gl_grib_api HARMONIE is now able to use ECMWF GRIB2 data for generation of boundaries. It's not however yet possible to convert to GRIB2 data.
 * List or convert a GRIB1 file with [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/37h1.2/PostPP/gl gl]

== BUFR and ODB ==

 BUFR is the archiving/exchange format for observations. Observation Database is used for efficient handling of observations on IFS. ODB used for both input data and feedback information.

== DDH (LFA files ) ==

 Diagnostics by Horizontal Domains allows you to accumulate fluxes from different packages over different areas/points. 
 
 * LFA files ( Autodocumented File Software )
 * [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article44&var_recherche=LFA&var_lang=en gmapdoc]
 * under util/ddh

== Misc ==
 
 * vfld/vobs files in a simple ASCII format used by the [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/37h1.2/PostPP/Verification verification].
 * NETCDF is used as output data for some SURFEX tools.
