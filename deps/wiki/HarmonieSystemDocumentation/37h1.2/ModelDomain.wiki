=== Model domain settings ===

Several domains are predefined in config_exp.h 

 * ''TSTEP'' is model timestep in seconds
 * ''NLON'' is number of points in x-direction.
 * ''NLAT'' is number of points in y-direction.
 * ''BDNLON'' is number of points in x-direction for intermediate climate file. ''BDNLON'' > ''NLON''.
 * ''BDNLAT'' is number of points in y-direction for intermediate climate file. ''BDNLAT'' > ''NLAT''.

''NLON'' and ''NLAT'' should satisfy the equation 5^b^ * 3^d^ * 2^e^,
where b-e are integers >= 0.

 * ''EZONE'' is number of points over extension zone in both x- and y-direction. Default value 11. 
 * ''LONC'' is the longitude of domain centre in degrees.
 * ''LATC'' is the latitude of domain center in degrees.
 * ''LON0'' is the reference longitude of the projection in degrees.
 * ''LAT0'' is the reference latitude of the projection in degrees. __If ''LAT0'' is set to 90, the projection is '''polar stereographic'''. If ''LAT0'' < 90, the projection is '''lambert''' unless LMRT=.TRUE..___  
 * ''LMRT'' switch for rotated Mercator projection. If LMRT=.TRUE. LAT0 should be zero.
 * ''GSIZE'' is grid size in meters in both x- and y-direction.

The default area is the Denmark domain. The following values for C+I zone and truncation are calculated in config_exp.h from the values above. 

 * ''NDLUXG'' is number of points in x-direction without extension (E) zone.
 * ''NDGUXG'' is number of points in y-direction without extension (E) zone.
 * ''NMSMAX_LINE'' is truncation order in longitude. By default (''NLON''-2)/2. 
 * ''NSMAX_LINE'' is truncation order in latitude. By default (''NLAT''-2)/2. 
 * ''NMSMAX_QUAD'' is truncation order in longitude. By default (''NLON''-2)/3. It is used to create filtered orography with lower resolution.
 * ''NSMAX_QUAD'' is truncation order in latitude. By default (''NLAT''-2)/3. It is used to create filtered orography with lower resolution.

Note that to run with LSPSMORO=yes you have to use a linear grid. I.e. NLON/NLAT must satisfy
