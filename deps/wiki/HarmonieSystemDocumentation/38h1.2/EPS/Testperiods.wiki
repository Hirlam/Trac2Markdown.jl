== IFS ENS initialized at 00 and 12 UTC ==
• Period 26.12.2011 - 8.1.2012

  
• Period 23.10.2011 - 7.11.2011

  
• Period 10.06.2012 - 28.06.2012


Two different configurations

• Exp: R,   Resolution: T639,       Ensemble size: 20+1,      FC range (d):  7

• Exp: H,   Resolution: T1279,      Ensemble size: 20+1,      FC range (d):  7

Use class=rd, expver=fsht for exp H, expver=frld for exp R.
Model level data is archived 1-hourly until a lead time of 48 h, and 3-hourly afterwards. IFS model
cycle 38R1. In order to keep the data volume manageable, model level data is archived regionally on
reduced Gaussian grids.


== IFS ENS initialized four times a day ==
• Period 10.05.2013 - 31.05.2013

00 and 12 UTC: class=rd, expver=g3y2

06 and 18 UTC: class=rd, expver=g3y3

In mars-retrieval maybe necessary to use: DATABASE = cca fdb (as data is not in mars, but on disk)

Configuration:

As operational ENS (model cycle 40r1) except for:

• run on Cray, therefore not bit-identical with operations (0001)

• 20+1 members instead of 50+1 members

• steps 0/to/144 every 3 hours (not including steps 150/to/360 every 6 hours)

• the 06 and 18 UTC runs use STREAM=scda analyses for the centre of the ensemble distribution and EDA perturbations based on 12-hour forecasts (instead of 6-hour forecasts)
