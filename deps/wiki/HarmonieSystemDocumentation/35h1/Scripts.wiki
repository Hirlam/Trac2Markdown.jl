== Introduction ==

In the following we describe some of the scripts used in the HARMONIE mSMS-system.

== sms/config_exp.h ==

[source:tags/harmonie-35h1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h] provides the highest top control level and includes the environment 
variables, which are used to control the experimentation. An additional configuration file is [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/include.ass include.ass] in which you set some of the assimilation options.
The following variables in config_exp.h can be changed by the user.

=== Experiment name and model geometry ===
* ''CNMEXP'' 4 character experiment name. This affects your filenames.
* ''DOMAIN'' Domain name. See about domain definition further down
* ''VLEV'' is the name of the vertical levels
    * BOUNDARIES, same as the boundaries

== Climate generation ==

=== Generation of a non SURFEX climate file at ECMWF ===
[source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Climate Climate] is a script, which prepares climate file(s) for 
prefered forecast range. Climate files are produced for past, present and following month. The outline of '''Climate''' is as follows:

 * Check if climate files already exists.
 * Creation of namelists (for quadratic and linear gird). The definition of domain and truncation values is taken from [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h].
 * Part 0: creation of __filtered orography__ by using quadratic grid with higher truncation. The resulting orography file must be renamed to __Neworog__. (default)

 An alternative way of preparing filtered orography is to use ''high order spectral smoothing for orography''.    This method is activated by setting ''SPSMORO=yes''. ''SPSMORO'' option is not well tested in HARMONIE.

 * Part 1: creation of __Neworog__ to target grid with lower truncation.
 * Part 2: generation of surface, soil and vegetation variables, without annual variation.
 * Part 3: creation of monthly climatological values and land-sea mask.
 * Part 4-9: creation of month specific data. 

 * Data: Climate database from ''HM_CLDATA''. ''HM_CLDATA'' is given in system configuration file, see the default path at ECMWF platform from [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/config-sh/config.ecgate config.ecgate].
 * Namelists: created in the script.
 * Executables: ''MODEL'', mandtg.
 * Output: climate files named as '''m01''', '''m02''' - '''m12''' and stored in ''CLIMDIR''.

__In order to run climate generation locally, one has to copy the climate database from ECFC directory ''HM_CLDATA''. See [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/config-sh/config.ecgate config.ecgate].__

=== Generation of climate files when SURFEX is used ===

The usage of SURFEX scheme sets some extra requirements for the climate file generation in the present HARMONIE system. Firstly, the SURFEX scheme and the atmospheric model are using __different__ climate/physiography files. Secondly, if the HARMONIE configuration with SURFEX is nested inside HIRLAM/IFS, an extra climate generation (for atmospheric model) is required.

The generation of the climate file for atmospheric model is performed the same way as in non-SURFEX case.

==== Intermediate climate file ====

In order to nest the HARMONIE with SURFEX to HIRLAM/IFS (see [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/35h1/Scripts#Boundaryfilecreation Boundary file creation]), an intermediate climate file is needed. The domain of this intermediate area must be slightly larger than the actual target domain. The size of the intermediate domain is given by ''BDNLON'' and ''BDNLAT'' (see [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/35h1/Scripts#Modeldomainsettings Model domain settings]).

The intermediate climate generation uses the same [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Climate Climate] script but it is launched from mSMS-task [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/sms/ClimateInter.sms ClimateInter] with different  input parameters.

The climate files for intermediate domain are named as '''m01''', '''m02''' - '''m12''' and are stored in ''BDCLIM'' directory

==== Preparation of SURFEX physiography file ====

The generation of SURFEX physiography file ('''PGD.lfi''') is done in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Prepare_pgd Prepare_pgd]. [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Prepare_pgd Prepare_pgd] creates the namelist __PRE_PGD1.nam__ based on the ''DOMAIN'' settings in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h]. 

The data base for SURFEX-file preparation is located at HPCE:
 * /hpce/ms_perm/mesonh_data/PGD/ecoclimats_v2.*
 * /hpce/ms_perm/mesonh_data/PGD/gtopo30.* 
 * /hpce/ms_perm/mesonh_data/PGD/sand_fao.*
 * /hpce/ms_perm/mesonh_data/PGD/clay_fao.*

The output is one SURFEX physiography file ('''PGD.lfi'''), which is stored in ''CLIMDIR'' directory.

__In order to try PGD generation locally, one has to copy the climate database from HPCE directory ''MESONH_DATA''. See [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/config-sh/config.ecgate config.ecgate].__

== Boundary file preparation ==

Boundary file preparation includes two parts: forecast file fetching and boundary file creation.

=== Boundary strategies ===

The current implemented boundary strategies are the following

 * same_forecast: Use all boundaries from the same forecast, start from an analysis 
 * analysis_only: Use only analyses as boundaries
 * latest       : Use the latest possible with the shortest forecast length
 * available    : Search for available files in BDDIR, try to keep forecast consistency. This is ment to be used operationally
 * operational  : Use 6h old boundaries
 * RCR_operational : Mimic the behaviour of the RCR runs, ie
                 *  12h old boundaries at 00 and 12 and
                 *  06h old boundaries at 06 and 18
 * jb_ensemble : Follows RCR_operational but uses boundaries from an ensemble experiment according to [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Get_ec2aladin Get_ec2aladin] 

The script Boundary_strategy.pl creates a file bdstrategy that could look like:

{{{
 Boundary strategy

       DTG: 2008100100
        LL: 6
     BDINT: 3
   BDCYCLE: 6
  STRATEGY: same_forecast
     BDDIR: /hpce/tmp/ms/se/snh/hm_home/35h1_trunk_6525_ALADIN/../trunk6532/ECMWF/
HOST_MODEL: ifs
 EXT_BDDIR: 
EXT_ACCESS: Get_ec2aladin
INT_BDFILE: /hpce/tmp/ms/se/snh/hm_home/35h1_trunk_6525_ALADIN/../trunk6532/boundaries/default/@YYYY@/@MM@/@DD@/@HH@/ELSCFHARMALBC@NNN@

# The output bdstrategy file has the format of 
# NNN|YYYYMMDDHH INT_BDFILE BDFILE BDFILE_REQUEST_METHOD 
# where 
# NNN        is the input hour
# YYYYMMDDHH is the valid hour for this boundary
# INT_BDFILE is the final boundary file
# BDFILE                is the input boundary file
# BDFILE_REQUEST_METHOD is the method to the request BDFILE from e.g. MARS, ECFS or via scp

000|2008100100 /hpce/tmp/ms/se/snh/hm_home/35h1_trunk_6525_ALADIN/../trunk6532/boundaries/default/2008/10/01/00/ELSCFHARMALBC000 /hpce/tmp/ms/se/snh/hm_home/35h1_trunk_6525_ALADIN/../trunk6532/ECMWF//fc20081001_00+000 Get_ec2aladin 2008100100 0 
...

}}}

Meaning that the if the INT_BDFILE not found an input file will be searched for under BDDIR. If no file is found there the command {{{Get_ec2aladin YYYYMMDDHH LLL BDDIR}}} will be executed. A local interpretation could be to search for external data if your file is not on BDDIR. Like the example from SMHI:

{{{
 Boundary strategy

       DTG: 2008081900
        LL: 06
     BDINT: 3
   BDCYCLE: 6
  STRATEGY: same_forecast
     BDDIR:/nobackup/smhid0/sm_uandr/hm_home/arome_main_33h1/G05/archive/YYYY/MM/DD/HH
HOST_MODEL: hir
 EXT_BDDIR: bore:/nobackup/prod3/hirlam/hirlam-7.1.2/G05/YYYY/MM/DD/HH
EXT_ACCESS: scp

000|2008081900 /nobackup/smhid0/sm_uandr/hm_home/arome_main_33h1/G05/archive/2008/08/19/00/an20080819_00+000 scp bore:/nobackup/prod3/hirlam/hirlam-7.1.2/G05/2008/08/19/00/an20080819_00+000
...

}}}

In this example an scp from bore will be executed if the expected file is not in BDDIR. [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Boundary_strategy.pl Read more in the in-code documentation]. The bdstrategy file is parsed by the script ExtractBD. 

 * [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/ExtractBD ExtractBD] Checks if data are on ''BDDIR'' otherwise copy from EXT_BDDIR. 
   The operation performed can be different depending on HOST and HOST_MODEL. IFS data at ECMWF are extracted from MARS, RCR data are copied from ECFS.
   * Input parameters: Forecast hour
   * Executables: none.

=== Boundary file creation ===

Boundary files (coupling files) for ALADIN/AROME are prepared in two different ways depending on the 
nesting procedure defined by  ''HOST_MODEL'' and ''PHYSICS'' [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/35h1/Scripts#smsconfig_exp.h config_exp.h].

 * [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/gl_bd gl_bd ] creates boundary file (FA) for ALADIN from HIRLAM/IFS file (GRIB). It is also the first step when you prepare boundary files for AROME.
   * Input parameters: Forecast hour, input file, output file.
   * Data: HIRLAM/IFS forecast file, ALADIN climate file (for target geometry).
   * Executables: gl, mandtg
   * Output: Boundary files (ELSCF*).

 * [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Prep_ini_surfex Prep_ini_surfex] creates an initial SURFEX file from an ALADIN file. The initial file is produced by [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?rubrique6 Fullpos], which is included in the ALADIN/AROME executable. 
   * Input parameters: Forecast hour.
   * Data: ALADIN forecast file, ALADIN climate file for both target and boundary geometry, Surfex climate file for the target geometry.
   * Namelists: namelist_e927_surfex.
   * Executables: gl, AROMODB, mandtg.
   * Output: a surfex initial file, SURFXINI.lfi.

 * [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/E927 E927] creates boundary files from a synoptic-scale ALADIN file. The boundary file is produced by [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?rubrique6 Fullpos], which is included in ALADIN/AROME executable. Environment variable ''DYNAMICS'' controls whether the boundary file is for a hydrostatic or a non-hydrostatic forecast.
   * Input parameters: Forecast hour, input file, output file.
   * Data: ALADIN forecast file, ALADIN climate file for both target and boundary geometry.
   * Namelists: namelist_e927
   * Executables: AROMODB, mandtg.
   * Output: Boundary files (ELSCF*).

== Forecast ==

[source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Forecast Forecast] is the script, which initiates actual 
forecast run (ALADIN/AROME/ALARO depending on ''FLAG'' and ''PHFLAG'').

 * Input parameters: none.
 * Data: Boundary files ('''ELSCF*'''-files). Initial file ('''fc_start'''). If data assimilation is used, '''fc_start''' is the analysis file. In case of dynamical adaptation, '''fc_start''' is the first boundary file. In case of AROME, Surfex initial file ('''SURFXINI.lfi''') is also needed ([source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Prep_ini_surfex Prep_ini_surfex]). 
 * Namelists: namelist templates nam/namelist_forecast are fetched based on the high level choices in config_exp.h. The templates are completed in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Forecast Forecast] based on the choices of ''NPROCX'', ''NPROCY'' (see [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/config-sh/submit.ecgate submit.ecgate]), ''TFLAG'', ''OUTINT'', ''BDINT'' and ''REDUCELFI''. In case of AROME also the namelists to control SURFEX-scheme  ([source:tags/harmonie-35h1/nam/TEST.des TEST.des] and [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/nam/EXSEG1.nam EXSEG1.nam]) are needed.
 * Executables: as defined by ''MODEL''.
 * Output: Forecast files (spectral files '''ICMSH${CNMEXP}+*'''). In case of Surfex, files containing the surface data ('''AROMOUT_*.lfi''') are produced. 

=== Forecast namelists ===

The current switches in the HARMONIE system (in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h]) provide only very limited possibility to control the different aspects of the model. If the user wants to have more detailed control on the specific schemes etc., one has to modify the variety of the namelists options.

In general, the different namelist options are documented in the source code modules (e.g. src/arp/module/*.F90). Below is listed information on some of the choices.   

__NH-dynamics/advection/time stepping__:

 * A detailed overview of the such options has been given by [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article189 Vivoda (2008)]. 
 
__Physics switches__

 * Switches related to different schemes of ALADIN/ALARO physics, [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomphy.F90 yomphy.F90].
 * Switches related to physics schemes in AROME [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomarphy.F90 yomarphy.F90].
 * Switches to tune different aspects of physics, [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomphy0.F90 yomphy0.F90], [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomphy1.F90 yomphy1.F90], [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomphy2.F90 yomphy2.F90] and [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomphy3.F90 yomphy3.F90]
 * Switches related to HIRLAM physics, [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yhloption.F90 yhloption.F90] and [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/setup/suhloption.F90 suhloption.F90].

__Initialization switch__

 * Initialization is controlled by namelist ''NAMINI/NEINI'', [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomini.F90 yomini.F90].

__Horizontal diffusion switches__

 * Horizontal diffusion is controlled by namelist ''NAMDYN/RDAMP*'', [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomdyn.F90#L55 yomdyn.F90]. Larger the coefficient, less diffusion.

__MPP switches__

 * The number of processors in HARMONIE are given in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/config-sh/submit.ecgate submit.HOST]. These values are transfered in to [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomct0.F90#L276 yomct0.F90] and [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yommp.F90 yommp.F90].

__SURFEX switches__

 * Surefex scheme is controlled through namelists [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/nam/TEST.des TEST.des] and [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/nam/EXSEG1.nam EXSEG1.nam]. The different options are described in [http://mesonh.aero.obs-mip.fr/mesonh/doc.html Externalized Surface User's guide].

== Archiving ==

Archiving has a two layer structure. Firstly, all the needed analysis forecast and field extract files  
are stored in ''ARCHIVE'' directory by [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Archive_fc Archive_fc]. This is the 
place where the postprocessing step expects to find the files. 

At ECMWF all the requested files are stored to ECFS into directory ''ECFSLOC'' by the script [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Archive_ECMWF Archive_ECMWF]

== Field extraction ==

[source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Run_fldver Run_fldver]. This script goes through all forecast files and 
collects all the variables (T2m, V10m, mean sea level pressure, RH2m, Q2m, total cloudiness, precipitation + profiles) 
needed in basic verification.

 * Input parameters: none.
 * Data: Forecast files.
 * Namelists: Station lists for surface data (ewglam.list) and radiosounding data (temp.list).
 * Executables: fldextr.
 * Output: Field extraction files (vfld${EXP}${DTG}), which are placed in ''EXTRARCH''.

== Extract observations ==

[source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/FetchOBS FetchOBS] scripts takes care of the observation 
extraction for verification. First, the observation BUFR-file is fetched from the MARS ('''ExtractVEROBSfromMARS'''), 
then all the needed data is extracted from the BUFR-files.

 * Input parameters: none.  
 * Data:  Station lists for surface data (ewglam.list) and radiosounding data (temp.list). These shoud be found from ''SCRDIR''  
 * Executables: mars, obsextr.  
 * Output: Field extraction files (vobs*), which are placed in ''EXTRARCH''.

== Fullpos postprocessing ==

Fullpos is a postprocessing package, which is part of the 
common ARPEGE/IFS cycle. Fullpos is documented by [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article17 El Khatib (2002)] and [http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmapdoc/spip.php?article157 Yessad (2008)].

[source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Postpp Postpp] script takes care about ''Fullpos'' postprocessing in HARMONIE system.   At the moment, postprocessing is performed at the end of each forecast cycle. [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Postpp Postpp] handles all the requested ''PPTYPE''s from one hour period. In case of hourly output and one ''PPTYPE'' only, Postpp executes ''Fullpos'' only once.

 * ''POSTP'' switch in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h] activates ''Fullpos''. __Fullpos in HARMONIE is available only when ''FLAG''= '''ald_h''' | '''ald_nh''' | '''arome'''__ !
 * [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/35h1/Scripts#Postprocessingandverification Postprocessing types].

 * Input parameters: none.
 * Input data:   
   1. Forecast files ('''ICMSH${CNMEXP}+*''') from directory ''WRK''.
   2. Climate files for both input and output geometry ('''m01''','''m02'''...'''m12'''). For now, postprocessing has been performed only  in the same forecast grid. Therefore input and output climate files are identical. 
   3. In case of satellite radiances (''PPTYPE''='''sat'''), ''Fullpos'' needs information from satellite coefficient files ('''rtcoef*.dat''' see e.g. [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/const/sat_const/rtcoef_noaa_17_amsua.dat rtcoef_noaa_17_amsua.dat]).
 * Namelists: namelist templates nam/namelist_pp are fetched based on ''FLAG''. The templates are completed in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Postpp Postpp] based on the choices made in ''NPROCX'', ''NPROCY'' (see [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/config-sh/submit.ecgate submit.ecgate]) and ''PPTYPE''.
 * Executables: as defined by ''MODEL''.
 * Output data: Postprocessed, spectral files ('''PFALADALADIN+*[md|pp|zz|sat]''') are stored to ''ARCHIVE'' directory.

=== Fullpos namelists ===

The current postprocessing switches in the HARMONIE system (in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/sms/config_exp.h config_exp.h]) provide only very limited possibility to control the variety of the aspects in ''Fullpos''. Currently, in different ''PPTYPE'' modes parameter lists, postprocessed domain and requested levels are fixed in  [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Postpp Postpp]. Below is part of  [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Postpp Postpp], which defines postprocessed parameters and requested pressure levels in case of ''FLAG''='''arome''' and ''PPTYPE''='''pp'''.

In the ''Fullpos'' namelist '''NAMFPC''' (variables explained in [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/module/yomfpc.F90 yomfpc.F90]), the variables are placed into different categories:

 * '''CFP3DF''' = names 3D dynamics fields to compute.
 * '''CFP2DF''' = names 2D dynamics fields to compute.
 * '''CFPPHY''' = names of physical fields to be postprocessed.
 * '''CFPXFU''' = names of instantaneous fluxes fields to be postproc.
 * '''CFPCFU''' = names of cumulated fluxes fields to be postproc.

Postprocessing can also be done in various type of levels:

 * '''RFP3P''' = postprocessing pressure levels
 * '''RFP3H''' = postprocessing height (above orography) levels.
 * '''RFP3TH''' = postprocessing potential temperature levels.
 * '''RFP3PV''' = postprocessing potential vorticity levels.

The default FA-names for parameters in different categories can be found from [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/src/arp/setup/suafn1.F90#L687 suafn1.F90]. The list of HARMONIE's output variables are  given also in [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/35h1/Forecast/Outputlist].
 
== File conversion ==

HIRLAM community is more used to deal with the GRIB-files. Therefore, the forecast files (FA) are converted 
to GRIB-files by [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/scr/Makegrib Makegrib]. By default, '''Makegrib'''
removes biperiodic zone from ALADIN files and creates GRIB-file in native (Lambert) projection.
The data in GRIB-file could be also interpolated into different projections, more information 
source:tags/harmonie-35h1/util/gl/README

 * Input parameters: Forecast hour.
 * Data: ALADIN/AROME forecast FA-file.
 * Namelists: none.
 * Executables: gl.
 * Output: GRIB-file (fc${DTG}+${LL}grib), which is stored in ''ARCHIVE'' directory.


If your on conversion from FA/lfi to grib get a message like

{{{
  Could not identify S025TENS.CONV.ZO
  Please add in inc/trans_tab.h
}}}

it means your variable is not known by the FA/lfi to GRIB [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/util/gl/inc/trans_tab.h translation table].
Please modify and recompile gl.
