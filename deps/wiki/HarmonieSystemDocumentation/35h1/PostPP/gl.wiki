== GL == 

 === GRIB/FA/LFI manipulation ===

 gl uses EMOSLIB ( or AUXLIBS), can be compiled with and without FA/LFI support, requires some IFS libraries. Can be used to list GRIB/ASIMOF/FA/LFI files.

 gl GRIB/ASIMOF-FILE
 gl -[l/f] FA/LFI-FILE
 gl -g gives you the GRIB/FA/LFI header
 gl -m prints min/mean/max values

FA/lfi files are converted to grib by gl

  gl -c FA/LFI-FILE, converts the full field (including extension zone)
  gl -p FAFILE, excludes the extension zone ( p as in physical domain )

  The FA/LFI 2 grib mapping is done in a table defined by a [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/util/gl/inc/trans_tab.h translation table]

  '''AD HOC coding of the translation'''

  gl -t to view the table
  gl -q to cross check duplicates

  Conversion can be tuned, to a subset of fields

 - scum conversion to GRIB/ASCII


 === fldextr and obsextr ===

  Fldextr extracts data from several sources (HIRLAM/IFS/AAA) and

   - recalculates rh,td to be over water (for HIRLAM)
   - Interpolates to geographical points according to a synop.list and temp.list
   - Does MSLP,RH2M,TD2M calculations if the are not available
   - Optional fraction of land check.
   - Interpolates to pressure levels for TEMP data.

Obsextr extracts BUFR data and creates an ascii file. similar to the vfld file.

   - Reads SYNOP and TEMP
   - LUSE_LIST controls the usage of a station list


== xtool ==

'''Xtool''' is part of '''gl'''-package provides utility to calculate differences between GRIB/FA files and give output to a new GRIB file. See xtool part of [source:tags/harmonie-35h1/util/gl/README#L221 gl-README]. Below is a simple example of how to use '''xtool'''

 What is the difference between +24h and +48h MSLP forecasts during August 2008?

 1. Namelist for '''xtool''', which lists the parameters (here mean sea level pressure) to be examined:

{{{
&NAMINTERP
  PPPKEY%ppp = 001,
  PPPKEY%lll = 000,
  PPPKEY%ttt = 103,
;
}}} 

 2. Run xtool.

{{{
xtool -sdtg1 2008080100 -edtg1 2008083000 -ll1 48 \
      -sdtg2 2008073100 -edtg2 2008082900 -ll2 24 \
      -p1 /your_model_data/YYYY/MM/HH/fcYYYYMMDD_HH+LLL \
      -p2 /your_model_data/YYYY/MM/HH/fcYYYYMMDD_HH+LLL \
      -fcint 6 -op DIFF -n your_namelist \
      -o output.grb
}}}

  * '''-sdtg1''', '''-edtg1''', '''-ll1''': The cycles to look for the +48h forecast.
  * '''-sdtg2''', '''-edtg2''', '''-ll2''': The cycles to look for the +24h forecast.
  * '''-p1''', '''-p2''': Naming rules for the files in cycle 1 and 2, respectively.
  * '''-fcint''': Interval between forecast cycles.
  * '''-op''': Operation to be applied. Possible choices ''DIFF'', ''SUM'', ''AVE'', ''STDV'' or ''SAL''
  * '''-n''': Namelist file.
  * '''-o''': Name of the output grib file.

 3. Output file ('''output.grb''') now contains one 2D-field with accumulated 48-24h difference of mean sea level pressure.  


== SAL ==

'''S'''tructure '''A'''mplitude '''L'''ocation ('''SAL''') is object based quality measure for the verification of QPFs ([http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1175%2F2008MWR2415.1 Wernli et al., 2008]). '''SAL''' contains three independent components that focus on Structure, Amplitude and Location of the precipitation field in a specified domain. 

 * '''S''': Measure of structure of the precipitation area (-2 - +2). Large '''S''', if model predicts too large precipitation areas.
 * '''A''': Measure of strength of the precipitation (-2 - +2). Large '''A''', if model predicts too intense precipitation.
 * '''L''': Measure of location of the precipitation object (0 - +2). Large '''L''', if modelled precipitation objects are far from the observed conterparts. 

 * '''SAL''' can be activated in '''xtool''' by using ''-op SAL'' option. e.g.

{{{
 xtool -f1 model.grib -f2 observation.grib -op SAL -n namelist
}}}

 * Output of the '''SAL''' are 2 simple ascii-files:
  1. ''scatter_plot.dat'' containing date, '''S''','''A''' and '''L''' parameters.
  2. ''sal_output.dat'' containing more detailed statistics collected during the verification (location of center of mass, number of objects, measure of object size etc.).
