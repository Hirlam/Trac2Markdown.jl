== Introduction ==

In the following we describe the procedure to interface the HIRLAM subversion repository to the !ClearCase repository at Meteo France. Further on, the tasks of the phasers and procedure to create a new branch is described.


=== Subversion <-> !ClearCase merging ===

The first thing to do is to fetch the latest branch from !ClearCase. In here we assume you have the access rights and the knowledge to connect to the right computers.

1) Check what is available

        cc_versions

2) Get a view of the the new version

        cc_getpack -r CY35T2 -b bf  -v 01 -u bf_01_hirlam

3) Extract the relevant directories into tar-file

        tar jcvf ~/CY35T2_bf.01.tbz2 --exclude=lost+found \
        aeo ald arp bip bla mpa mse odb sat sur tal tfl uti xla xrd

4) Exit
        . cc_quit


Transfer the tarfile to your preferred platform

=== Merge into vendor branch ===

To import source code from an external vendor we use the script 
[http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html#svn.advanced.vendorbr.svn_load_dirs svn_load_dis.pl]

Unpack your tar file in a directory with a proper name, e.g. CY35T2_bf.01. Check out vendor/aladin/current as current-wc in a parallel directory.

Now we are ready to start the merge:

svn_load_dirs.pl -v -wc current-wc https://svn.hirlam.org/vendor/aladin current CY35T2_bf.01

svn copy -m "Tag vendor/aladin/current as vendor/aladin/cy35t2_bf.01." https://svn.hirlam.org/vendor/aladin/current https://svn.hirlam.org/vendor/aladin/cy35t2_bf.01


=== Update !ClearCase ===

There are two help scripts under merou:/home/mrpm624/

cc_patch_commit

cc_patch_checkout

[[BR]]

To put things into clearcase

cc_getview
cc_export -b -c -h tori -p master


The changes should be described in a similar way as in:

== Preparations before phasing ==

== HARMONIE phasing tasks ==
