== '''GLAMEPS Production System: Technical Information for Users''' ==
Last modified on [[LastModified]]
[[Center(end)]]

This page contains technical information for GLAMEPS users, who intend to utilize GLAMEPS products. The documentation refers to the GLAMEPS production system version 2 (GLAMEPSv2).

== '''General Information''' ==

=== Setup ===

GLAMEPS is installed on the computers at ECMWF and uses the ECMWF EPS as boundary model. GLAMEPS production makes use of the SMS facility to control the production process.

The GLAMEPS ensemble is a 48+4-member multi-model ensemble, with 4 control members plus 48 perturbed members, the latter of which include lagging. GLAMEPS is run over 4 cycles per day for hours 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC, where each cycle runs a 24+4 member ensemble. The member configuration is such that two consecutive cycles make up a full 48+4 member ensemble.

GLAMEPS comprises following models (please note that member '000' refers to 'control member'):

|| '''acronym''' || '''model name'''     || '''type''' || '''contributed members''' ||
|| HirEPS_S      || Hirlam STRACO        || LAM        || 000, 001 - 006, 007 - 012 ||
|| HirEPS_K      || Hirlam !Kain/Fritsch || LAM        || 000, 013 - 018, 019 - 024 ||
|| AloEPS_S      || Alaro SURFEX         || LAM        || 000, 025 - 030, 031 - 036 ||
|| AloEPS_I      || Alaro ISBA           || LAM        || 000, 037 - 042, 043 - 048 ||

The numbering of the ensemble members coincides with the numbering in the 50+1 member ECMWF EPS, and the LAM models utilize the respective ECMWF EPS ensemble members as boundary model. The model acronym is used in order to identify a model when accessing data from the GLAMEPS system.


=== Cycling ===

GLAMEPS does not run all ensemble members within one single cycle, as was done in GLAMEPSv1. Instead GLAMEPS splits the perturbed ensenmble members into two groups, which are run in an alternating manner when moving from one cycle to the next one. Following table shows the distribution of the perturbed ensemble members for the daily cycles:

||             |||||||| '''perturbed members''' ||
|| '''cycle''' || '''HirEPS_S''' || '''HirEPS_K''' || '''AloEPS_S''' || '''AloEPS_I''' ||
||   `00`      ||   001 - 006    ||   013 - 018    ||   025 - 030    ||   037 - 042    ||
||   `06`      ||   007 - 012    ||   019 - 024    ||   031 - 036    ||   043 - 048    ||
||   `12`      ||   001 - 006    ||   013 - 018    ||   025 - 030    ||   037 - 042    ||
||   `18`      ||   007 - 012    ||   019 - 024    ||   031 - 036    ||   043 - 048    ||

The unperturbed control runs for each of the models, members identified by 000 identifier, are run at each cycle.

This ensemble configuration leads to a full ensemble when combining the perturbed members from two consecutive cycles, and adding the control runs from the newsest cycle. This way, GLAMEPS is capable of providing ensemble products every 6 hours, while optimizing use of available computer resources.

As GLAMEPS users have access to the model output data (see below), they are free to compile another ensemble member composition from the GLAMEPS members, and apply their own post-processing on that.


== '''Product data''' ==

Following post-processing products are available:

=== Probability Maps ===

Probability maps for atmospheric parameters, where each ensemble member is equally weighted. The processed parameters comprise:

|| '''acronym''' || '''parameter'''              || '''product'''             ||
|| AccPcp3h      || 3h accumulated precipitation || probability maps          ||
|| G10m          || wind gust at 10m             || probability maps          ||
|| Pmsl          || mean sea level pressure      || ensemble mean/spread maps ||
|| S10m          || wind at 10m                  || probability maps          ||
|| S925          || wind at 925hPa level         || probability maps          ||
|| T2m           || temperature at 2m            || probability maps, ensemble mean/spread maps ||
|| T850          || temperature at 850hPa level  || ensemble mean/spread maps ||
|| Z500          || geopotential at 500hPa level || ensemble mean/spread maps ||


=== Meteograms (GLAMEPS-o-GRAMs) ===

These are meteograms from selected locations, including graphs for temperature, wind and precipitation. The GLAMEPS-o-GRAMs can be viewed on the [https://hirlam.org/portal/GLAMEPS/test/index.html GLAMEPS product test portal], or accessed on the ''GLAMEPS disk'' (see below).

The data shown in a GLAMEPS-o-GRAM is available as point data in the [#Tableextractionsofpointdata table extraction data].



=== Data Access ===

All product data for GLAMEPS is currently available from the ''GLAMEPS data disk'' on the ECMWF computer system:

 [[Color(green, ecgate:/ms_crit/glameps_op/PROD/Products/Data/)]] contains the product maps in GRIB2 files

 [[Color(green, ecgate:/ms_crit/glameps_op/PROD/Products/Plots/)]] contains the product maps as graphics in the formats ''eps'' and ''png''

 [[Color(green, ecgate:/ms_crit/glameps_op/PROD/Products/GLograms/)]] contains the 'GLAMEPS-o-GRAMs' in ''pdf'' format

 [[Color(green, ecgate:/ms_crit/glameps_op/PROD/Products/FCtables/)]] contains point extractions data in ''Sqlite'' format

These directories each contain a directory identifying the GLAMEPS product group named by prefix 'Gl.PROD'. Further below the path, data is stored for each parameter under a date-time tree of the form
{{{
<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<HH>/
}}}

for the first three of the above mentioned data paths. The date-time specification refers to the cycle, under which the products were produced. The last of the above mentioned data paths contains just a monthly-wise sub-directory structure:
{{{
<yyyy>/<mm>/
}}}

thus gathering data for a whole month.


[[Color(red, NOTE: In order to access GLAMEPS data on the ECMWF computers you must be member of the UNIX group 'glampes')]]


== '''Model output data''' ==

The GLAMEPS model output data currently can be found on the ''GLAMEPS data disk'' under [[Color(green, ecgate:/ms_crit/glameps_op/PROD/)]]. Down this path data for each model can be found structured as follows:
{{{
<model acronym>/Outdat/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<HH>/mbr<nnn>/
<model acronym>/Secdat/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<HH>/mbr<nnn>/
<model acronym>/Caldat/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<HH>/mbr<nnn>/
}}}

With the model acronym being one of '''AloEPS_I''', '''AloEPS_S''', '''HirEPS_K''', '''HirEPS_S'''. The date-time specification is self-explainatory, and ensemble member identification is by the sub-directory ''mbr<nnn>'', with ''<nnn>'' refering to the member number.

Below the above mentioned two paths, model data can be found in files separated by forecast length:
{{{
fc<yyyy><mm><dd>_<HH>+<fcl>gl
}}}

where date and time specification is the same as above, and <fcl> depicts the forecast length.

In cases where a model partly or completely fails to produce a forecast, the expected output data is replaced by backup data, which is represented by a [[Color(cyan, symbolic link)]], in order to indicate clearly that this is backup data. The [[Color(cyan, symbolic link)]] comes with following characteristics:

  * the name of the [[Color(cyan, symbolic link)]] is identical with the name of the original file name, like e.g.
{{{
  fc20141211_06+021gl
}}}
  * the [[Color(cyan, symbolic link)]] points to the file, which is to backup the original file. The file name of this backup file is similar to the original one and indicates where it is comming from. In the mentioned example this would look like
{{{
  fc20141211_06+021gl -> /ms_crit/glameps_op/PROD/HirEPS_K/Outbak/HirEPS_K/2014/12/10/18/mbr023/fc20141210_18+033gl
}}}
    where the backup file is from the 12h older cycle with 12h longer forecast length.

[[Color(red, NOTE: the GRIB header of a backup file reflects the date-time group of the backup, not of the symbolic link)]]

As indicated by the above two paths, the model output data is separated into two output streams:


=== Main Output Stream ('''Outdat''') ===

The ''main stream'' '''Outdat'''. It is the major output stream from GLAMEPS. This data is archived into 'ECFS'. It contains following parameters:

=== Secondary Output Stream ('''Secdat''') ===

This is the ''secondary stream'' '''Secdat'''. This output stream contains many additional parameters, and it may also contain experimental records. The '''Secdat''' data files may contain different records depending on the underlying LAM model. The following list provides an overview:

Note that the occcurrence of a data record in the '''Secdat''' stream does NOT imply that the data is consistent between different models. It may become necessary for the user to consult documentation and code internals from the LAM models in order to check for full consistency. However, within a single model familiy, like AloEPS or HirEPS, '''Secdat''' data records can be considered consistent.

The data from a specific model of the GLAMEPS ensemble may contain further records in '''Secdat''' in addition to the above listed.

[[Color(red, NOTE: The data from the secondary data stream (Secdat) is not archived, and thus only available on disk for a certain period of time.)]]

The data is kept on disk for about 5 days, then it is removed and cannot be restored again.


=== Calibrated Output stream ('''Caldat''') ===
This output stream contain statistically calibrated forecasts and are available under the following path:
{{{
<model acronym>/Caldat/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<HH>/mbr<nnn>/                           
}}}

The following parameters have been calibrated:
||= '''Parameter''' || '''GRIB number''' || '''Level Type''' || '''Level''' || '''Unit''' =||
|| Temperature 2m                             ||  11 || 105 ||   2 || K ||
|| U-wind 10m                                 ||  33 || 105 ||  10 || m/s ||
|| V-wind 10m                                 ||  34 || 105 ||  10 || m/s ||
                                                                                  
Calibrated forecasts are made by training statistical models on historical point observations and forecasts and applying these models to the raw model output. The statistical models adjust the raw forecasts such that derived probabilities are more reliable.

For T2m, a normal distribution is used with the following parameters:            
{{{
mean  = a + b * ensemble_mean + c * model_elevation                               
stdev = exp(d + e * log(ensemble_std) + f * log(max(1,model_elevation)))                                              
}}}
Values for a-f are estimated by using observations and forecasts for the 42 most recent days and are updated every week. Separate values are estimated for each 3h time period and for each forecast cycle independently. This model improves both the central tendency of the ensemble as well as the spread of the members.

For surface winds, the calibration is done on the windspeed (not on U and V separately) and the direction is kept the same. A box-cox t-distribution is used to model windspeed with the following parameters:
{{{
mu    = a + b * ensemble_mean + c * model_elevation
sigma = exp(d + e * log(ensemble_std) + f * log(max(1,model_elevation)))
nu    = g + h * ensemble_mean
tau   = exp(i)
}}}
The rough interpretation of these four parameters is that mu is the median of the distribution, sigma the variance, nu the skewness, and tau the kurtosis.        

Once the parameters have been estimated, the calibration of the forecasts can commence. The GLAMEPS members are read in and a distribution is created for each gridpoint using the above-mentioned models. To convert the distribution back to ensemble members again, evenly spaced quantiles are extracted from the distribution. These quantiles are then reordered such that the calibrated members have the same order as in the raw files (that is the rank of each member is conserved).

== '''Archived data'''==

The ''GLAMEPS disk'' will store model output and products data back in time from the '''Main Output Stream''' for a certain amount of days. If data is not available from the ''GLAMEPS disk'' it can be found in the 'ECFS' archive below the path [[Color(green, ec:/zno/PROD/)]].

[[Color(red, Note that data from the '''Secondary Output Stream''' is '''NOT ARCHIVED AT ALL''' - it is available from disk for a couple of days only!)]].

The sub-directory structure in the archive is similar to the structure on the ''GLAMEPS disk''. However, please be aware that data is packed together using ''ecfsdir'' in chunks of one cycle, i.e. a '.../<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<HH>/' directory is stored on 'ECFS' in one file.
In order to retrieve data, you should use the 'ecfsdir' command, like e.g.:

{{{
==> ecfsdir ec:/zno/PROD/AloEPS_I/Outdat/2014/09/29/18 AloEPS_I_Outdat_for_2014092918
}}}

[[Color(red, NOTE: In order to access GLAMEPS data on the ECMWF computers you must be member of the UNIX group 'glampes')]]


== '''TC1 - signals''' ==

GLAMEPS issues signals of type ''time-critical option 1'' in order to facilitate timely triggering of GLAMEPS user processes. The signals can be listed using the ecels command on 'ecgate':

{{{
==> ecaccess-event-list | grep GLAMEPS
}}}
