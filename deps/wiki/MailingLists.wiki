= HIRLAM Mailing Lists =

We aim to develop the HIRLAM mailing list facility into a primary form of the internal communication and discussions between the HIRLAM developers. If you are new to [http://www.gnu.org/ GNU] [http://www.list.org/ Mailman], you will find answers to most of you question in the [http://www.list.org/mailman-member/index.html List Member Manual]. Otherwise please contact [mailto:support@hirlam.org support@hirlam.org]
