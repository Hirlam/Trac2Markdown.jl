== '''SHELL problem''' ==

'''This is still an issue.'''

It has been noticed that ksh and csh at ecgb doesn’t pass the environment properly to cray. '''It seems that only bash behaves correctly, but just opening a bash session doesn’t solve the problem'''. See forum post from Elena at FMI: [http://www.hirlam.org/index.php/forum/19-general-topics/1142-ssh-feature-in-ecmwf-cca-solved http://www.hirlam.org/index.php/forum/19-general-topics/1142-ssh-feature-in-ecmwf-cca-solved]

To change the default shell on ecgb type:
{{{

}}}

and follow the instructions.
