Current status at SMHI, Sweden

Current status at FMI, Finland: First tests run at ECMWF computers. Slow progress expected, effort 1-2mm/year.

Current status at Met Ã‰ireann: In the past local OPERA BUFR volume data has been converted to MF BUFR using CONRAD and tested. In the future I plan to use the data cleaned and hosted by BALTRAD (odc.baltrad.eu) in radar assimilation tests. At the moment I don't have access to UK data.
