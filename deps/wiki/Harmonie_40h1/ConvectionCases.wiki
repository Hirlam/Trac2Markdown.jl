== Background ==

This web-page contains the results from experiments that have been done to find the causes for the insufficient quality of the convection in some cases in HARMONIE 40h1.1. These experiments have been performed by Met.no, SMHI, FMI and KNMI. The AEMET results will be uploaded in the near future. The KNMI-presentation contains a summary of the results and discussion items.

== Status March 2019 ==

From all the experiments it was clear that there is not one single issue with convection in HARMONIE CY40h1.1/40h1.2. There are several. The most important ones are the missing of some severe deep convection by the latest HARMONIE-AROME versions and the missing of showers that are not too deep and have cloud tops that are warmer than -15Â°C. 

The first problem has two main causes:
- a negative impact of the surface assimilation on the availability of moisture in the boundary layer. This can be improved by using smaller increments of soil moisture in the surface data assimilation (HARMONIE-AROME uses a background error file of soil moisture that has values that are a factor 6 larger than Meteo France uses). This smaller impact of the soil moisture analysis has to be accompanied by changes in the LAI or stomatal resistance that reduce the evaporation. These changes will reduce the negative impact of the surface DA as reported by MetCoOp in [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Harmonie_40h1/ConvectionCases/convection_test_without_t2mrh2m_surf_assim.pdf this report].
- a stronger mixing from above into the boundary layer leading to a too dry boundary layer top. This is caused by the HARATU update that was included in HARMONIE CY40h1.1. The last item has a negative impact especially when the convection starts around or after the time that the heating of the boundary layer becomes small. When the situation is less sensitive the convection is sometimes represented very well by the reference HARMONIE-AROME CY40h1.1. Reverting the HARATU update enables this borderline convection, but it may lead to worse representation of the convection when it starts in the middle of the heating period?

The second problem is very strongly depending on the shallow convection part of HARATU. All clouds are represented by the shallow convection scheme in the case of relatively warm clouds, visible in a smooth cloud cover of 60-100% in an area where there is a high variability in cloud cover due to the open cell nature of the convection in these cases. No precipitation in this case causes no feedback of the precipitation on the dynamics and no open cell structure can form this way. A removal of the shallow convection part in these cases leads to resolved convection, but too much in the way of cloud streets and not enough in the form of open cell convection. This may be caused by the structure of the boundary layer at the inflow boundary.

A third problem is the missing of stratiform precipitation that is generated by anvils in the dying stages of a convective cell. It is suspected that this is caused by microphysics (too much graupel being formed) together with an anvil that is not large due to the too quick removal of moisture through the quickly falling graupel (compared to cloud ice and snow).

== Strategy ==

Based on all the information from the experiments below I have tried to compile [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Harmonie_40h1/ConvectionCases/Strategy_convection.pdf a document] where I propose a strategy to follow to try and solve or at least decrease the convection problems that are found in many places. As problematic areas seem to be the surface, microphysics and turbulence/shallow convection it involves a lot of changes to hopefully arrive at a version of HARMONIE that works satisfactory.

Comments: As expected, decreased LAI and increased Rsmin lead to warmer and drier near-surface conditions. However, depending on region this leads to better or worse verification scores. For the southern part of the domain (Denmark and Gotaland) the changes increases biases and lead to too warm and too dry conditions. For south-mid Sweden (only remaining snow in the mountains in the western part) the changes lead to that the cold bias is reduced while the conclusion for humidity depend on forecast length (good, less positive bias for short forecast lengths but worse, too dry for longer forecast lengths). For the northern half of Sweden (2/3 still snow covered) the changes lead to better conditions, cold bias is reduced and moist bias is reduced. So, in conclusion, this short test, for this specific domain/period show that default settings are good in the south while modified settings are better in the north.

=== DMI cases ===
   * The [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Harmonie_40h1/ConvectionCases/Feddersen_DMI.pdf Feddersen_DMI.pdf] shows a case where the impact of different forecast times, initial conditions and physics/dynamics settings are studied. Main conclusion from this is that the initial conditions (surface?) are most important and that turbulence and microphysics have a more limited impact.

=== KNMI cases ===
   * The [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Harmonie_40h1/ConvectionCases/20180123_Convection_Tijm.ppt PPT-presentation] shows a few examples of missed showers by HARMONIE-AROME 38h1.2+ compared to HARMONIE-AROME 36h1.4. Also the results from a few experiments with the physics are shown. I have added a summary of all the experiments that have been done so far and some preliminary conclusions to this presentation. Please walk through them and let me know your ideas.
   * The [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Harmonie_40h1/ConvectionCases/WdR_small_showers_1.pdf WdR_small_showers_1.pdf] and [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Harmonie_40h1/ConvectionCases/WdR_small_showers_2.pdf WdR_small_showers_2.pdf] show the results of experiments that were performed by Wim, together with a discussion of the results. Also the effect of a bugfix with LTOTPREC is shown (in the second document).

=== AEMET cases ===
   * The presentation shows several sensitivity tests done for a summer convective period trying to understand the underestimation of convective activity in cycle 40 versions. Physics choices have some impact but not as big as expected. See [https://hirlam.org/portal/aemet/ConvectionCases/convection_tests_aemet.pdf convection_tests_aemet.pdf]
