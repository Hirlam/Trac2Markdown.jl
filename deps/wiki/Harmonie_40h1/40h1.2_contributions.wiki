This page is a working document for the development going from harmonie-40h1.1 to harmonie-40h1.2. Please check [wiki:Harmonie_40h1/40h1.2_validation Validation of HARMONIE-40h1.2] for a list of suggested tests and for experiments and corresponding verification.

The HIRLAM Management Group (MG) have discussed potential updates for cycle 40h1.2 in order to improve, in particular, the poor T2m temperatures and clouds seen over the IBERIA domain during winter with cycle 40h1.1 (in comparison to cycle 38h1.2). The following ongoing developments could potentially enter cycle 40h1.2, which we would like to start testing over the RCR domains. 

== Potential model updates for cycle 40h1.2 ==

=== Microphysics ===

1. Included as optional: LGRSN flag (conversion of graupel to snow, when mixing ratio of graupel is very small.)
2. Freezing rain update 
3. Bug fixes for stratospheric warming
4. Accretion changes that were present in cycle 38, but fell out going to cycle 40, 43. 

=== Turbulence ===

=== Convection ===
7. Included as optional: Improved microphysics in EDMF. 

=== Dynamics ===
8. COMAD

=== Surface ===
9. Included as optional: [wiki:HarmonieWorkingWeek/Surface201604/Two_patches_development Two patches] 
10. Turn off CANOPY model (required if running with two patches)
11a. Bug fix by Katya related to interpolation of all physiography fields in PGD. This bug fix excludes the impact of NHALO in SURFEX which decides how far away SURFEX should look for physiography information when the physiography input field is coarse wit respect to the model grid.

11b. Included as optional: FLake: Ekaterina Kourzeneva at FMI is working on to make FLake operational in cy40h running in "peaceful coexistence", i.e. without lake data assimilation. This development takes place in branch [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/branches/harmonie-40h1_FLake].
15. Deviation accepted on request from !MetCoOp which will not be carried over to future cycles: Consider “tuning” for interaction between deep soil temperature and surface temperature in “force restore”. Based on Metcoop experience where improved forecast scores are reached by modified OI coefficient for deep soil temperature in oi_cacsts.F90 and with modified snow melt in isba_fluxes.F90.

=== Other ===

18. Remove smoothing of orography in PGD. This is related to namelist NAM_ZSFILTER in SURFEX where the default namelist setting NZSFILTER=1 means that 1 iteration of the spatial filter applied to smooth the orography is applied. This has been an unknown setting for a while and we wish to have smoothing done only in the atmosphere part of the code. Thus, new setting should be NZSFILTER=0.

19. Included as optional: SPPT - if ready

=== Excluded options at update by HMG February 1st 2017 ===

5. Harmonization of ice crystal spectrum so it is the same in the sedimentation code as in rest of rain_ice.F90
6. Tune the “level of mixing” in HARATU: FAC_TWO_COEF 2-> 1 or 1.5
12. Soil temperature dependent LAI: Sander Tijm et al. at KNMI are investigating the possibility to adjust LAI to current weather via soil temperature. (Now questionable if someone would have time to investigate/develop this option further)
13. [wiki:HarmonieWorkingWeek/Surface201604/Glacier_plans  Glaciers]: Affects mainly Greenland and Iceland domains. (Discussions during autumn 2016 has led to the conclusion that all glacier development will be focused on cy43/SURFEXv8 environment).
14. [wiki:HarmonieWorkingWeek/Surface201604/Snow_assimilation_plans Assimilation of snow extent]. (The result of this work is planned to enter cy43h)
15+. Investigate if/how surface diagnostics can be modified based on [http://hirlam.org/index.php/forum/surface-development/1257-near-surface-diagnostics discussion in HIRLAM Forum]. (This is mainly connected to the impact of 2 patches on U10m. Now the 2-patches are set as optional and therefore this investigation is not crucial any more for a new cycle release).
16. Cloud initialization
17. VSIGQSAT is default 0.02. (Modified values in the range 0.02-0.04 has been considered without clear improvements).
