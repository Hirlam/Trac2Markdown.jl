== Subversion, Trac and Wiki ==

See [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] and [http://www.edgewall.com/trac/ Trac]

Subversion is a popular upgrade of the CVS version control system. It
   
  *  Is open source software without licensing issues 
  *  Is provided with professional support by the development company, for those who want that 
  *  Has been developed to overcome the weaknesses seen in the CVS system 

Hirlam Subversion is complemented by web-based Trac interface powered by wiki engine. Trac is: 
   
  *  An integrated system for managing software projects 
  *  An enhanced wiki 
  *  A flexible web-based issue tracker 
  *  An interface to the Subversion revision control system 

Trac lets software project developers and users track, use and manage:   
 * software issues 
 * bug reports 
 * feature requests 
 * overall progress over time 
 * project tasks 
 * source code changes 
 * documentation / wiki text 

Trac provides a view onto a Subversion respository that is integrated with an issues tracking system rather than being a GUI interface to Subversion.
