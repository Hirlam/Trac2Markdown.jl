 * '''Sensitivity of surface parameter post-processing''' for verification. The HIRLAM surface scheme since 7.3 featurs modelling for 7 surface tiles and it has been an open issue as to how to compare model parameters to the observation data. For observation verification of SYNOP and TEMP data, the reference HIRLAM now uses weighted average from open land tiles (3 and 4) for verification of T2m, Q2m, TD2m and RH2m, whereas for other surface parameters such as MSLP, W10m, all-tile weighted sum are used in comparison. In the following comparison, we compare the verification results using reference setting for the reference RCR run (run at FMI) and the 7.4 trunk run (run at ECMWF, referred to as RCR_T, RCR_74T or RCR_74B in the figures). In addition, we use the model level data from RCR and RCR-trunk runs to derive verification data using a) weighted, grid sum (Rgrid and Wgrid), b) weighted sum using open tiles 1,2,3,4, (Ropen and Wopen) and c) weighted sum using open land tile 3+4, (Rland and Wland). In these notations R stands for reference 7.3, W stands for 7.4 trunk.
