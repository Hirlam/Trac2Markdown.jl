== Highlights of 7.1.3 ==

Hirlam 7.1.3 is bug fix update for the current Hirlam reference system, [wiki:Hirlam_7.1]. The update consists of two source code corrections to the latest official version, Hirlam 7.1.2. The first one, changesets [5579],[5581], corrects the summation for total, stratiform and convective precipitation output for STRACO condensation scheme. The error was introduced when porting the re-corded STRACO subroutines in F90 to the system, in which rain and snow were summed separately. Due to the bug, the accumulated precipitation total as represented by  GRIB parameter 061 (total), 062 (stratiform) and 063 (convective) do not include snow contribution. The second source code change, changeset [5591], corrects a bug introduced in changeset [4887] and [4888] when total cloud cover was included in GRIB i/o. Due to the bug a restart in forecast step would fail to initialize cloud cover correctly using input information, which affects cloud and precipitation spin-up during forecast integration, especially in scenarios with no explicit initialisation (such as the forecasts integrations during and after 4D-VAR minimization). 

The first of the above bugs affects all 7.1 code series but it has no meteorological impact to reference forecast, except for applications in which GRIB parameter 061, 062 and 063 are used, such as precipitation verification and graphics. The second of the above bugs affects all 7.1 code series since Jan 2007. While it is expected to only minor impact on the reference forecast with 7.1, it has a clearly negative impact on moisture spin-up at 4D-VAR analysis option. 

Hirlam 7.1.3 now replaces that of Hirlam 7.1.2 as official Hirlam reference version. The complete source code of Hirlam 7.1.3 can be obtained by either

 * Subversion command
{{{
   svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/hirlam-7.1.3
}}}
 * Source code tarball, available from ECMWF ecgate:/scratch/ms/dk/nhz/hirlam-7.1.3.tar.gz or ecfs:/hirlam/src/tar/hirlam-7.1.3.tar.gz which contains the sandbox (check-out version) of the Hirlam 7.1.3
