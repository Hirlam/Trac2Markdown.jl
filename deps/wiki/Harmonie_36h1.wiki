Harmonie 36h1 is HIRLAM's adaptation to the IFS/ALADIN Cycle 36T1 released Jan 2010 and the subsequent bugfix versions 1 to 9. On 13 of July 2011, [source:tags/harmonie-36h1.4 harmonie-36h1.4] is tagged as an official release, to serve the needs for operational as well as research applications in the HIRLAM member services. At its default, HARMONIE-36h1.4 features a meso-scale forecast system with convection-permitting AROME physics, 3D-VAR upper air assimilation, and an optimal interpolation-based surface analysis, on a model grid with 2.5 km grid-spacing in horizontal and 65 vertical levels. Harmonie-36h1.3 also includes a comprehensive set of scripts and utilities supporting various optional components and applications.

Harmonie 36h1 includes features contained in cycle 36T1 and subsequent 9 source code bug fixes. See the detailed listing as contained in the documentations at the bottom of this page about features entering cycle 36T1, in comparison to cycle 35T1, in the attached cycle-specific memorandum in pdf format. In addition, 36h1-series contain
 * Hirlam's local source code updates including those options for an improved physical parameterisation, code optimisations
 * a comprehensive set of system scripts to help users to adapt for various applications, such as those for build, running testbed, experimenting with domains, assimilation options (3D-VAR, 4D-VAR, CANARI, CANARY-OI-MAIN), forecasts with ALARO/AROME/ALADIN physics, different coupling method, and post-processing and diagnosis such as for monitoring and verification
 * a comprehensive set of utilities, among them, the build tool based on gnumake (MAKEUP)

== Model Installation and Experiment Configuration ==

Users are referred to the system wiki documentation about [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/Installation Information and Instruction on basic system installation and experiment configuration].

=== Configure and Launch Harmonie experiments from ECMWF-ecgate ===

At ECMWF HPC platform, by default, the mSMS script uses the front-end ecgate to configure and launch experiments, whereas C1A is used for all computations except those for operations related to observation verification and monitoring.

As in the previous versions, the reference ROOTPACK for 36h1.4 has been pre-built and available on ECMWF C1A, under /ms_perm/hirlam/harmonie/precompiled for MAKEUP option and /ms_perm/hirlam/harmonie/pack for GMKPACK option

Following example shows steps to launch an Harmonie-36h1.4 experiment $EXP on ECMWF platform:

 1. Create an experiment directory under $HOME/hm_home and run the setup
{{{
   mkdir -p $HOME/hm_home/$EXP; cd $HOME/hm_home/$EXP      # the experiment name can be artificially chosen
                                                           # but it must not contain "."
   ~hlam/Harmonie setup           # this by default points the model version to the latest tagged Harmonie release; or
   PATH_TO_HARMONIE36H14_SOURCE/config-sh/Harmonie setup -r PATH_TO_HARMONIE_36H14_SOURCE -h YOURHOST -c YOURCONFIGURATION
                                 # for non-ECMWF platform
}}}
 1. If applicable, put your local source or script changes, which are different but consistent with the reference repository, into the current $HOME/hm_home/$EXP directory, with exactly the same subdirectory structure as in the reference. e.g, if you want to modify a subroutine
{{{
   cd $HOME/hm_home/$EXP;
   ~hlam/Harmonie co suphy.F90           # this will create src/arp/setup/suphy.F90
   vi src/arp/setup/suphy.F90           # modify the source code
}}}
 1. Edit basic configuration files such as [source:tags/harmonie-36h1.4/config-sh/config.ecgate Env_system -> config-sh/config.YOURHOST] and [source:tags/harmonie-36h1.4/sms/config_exp.h sms/config_exp.h] to configure your experiment scenarios. 
   * In case you prefer to use GMKPACK as build tool, edit the file Env_system to specify 
{{{
MAKEUP=no
}}}
   * Modify specifications for model versions (ALADIN, AROME, ALARO), data locations, settings for dynamics, physics, domain, coupling host model etc. e.g,
{{{
   ~hlam/Harmonie co scr/include.ass         # retrieve default 3DVAR configuration script include.ass
   vi scr/include.ass                       # modify the script
}}}
 1. Launch the experiment
{{{
      PATH_TO_HARMONIE/config-sh/Harmonie start DTG=YYYYMMDDHH DTGEND=YYYYMMDDHH LLMAIN=24
                 # e.g., ~hlam/Harmonie start DTG=2008030500 DTGEND=2008030618 LLMAIN=24
                 # would enable you to run cycles starting from first one in 2008030500 and last one in
                 # 2008030618 as last cycle, every 6 h, with forecast length of 24h at 00 and 12 UTC, 
                 # and 6 h at 06/18 UTC
                 # if DTGEND above is not given, it will be assued that DTGEND=$DTG
}}}
If successful, mSMS will identify your experiment name, launch mXcdp and start build and run. If not, you need to examine the mSMS log file $HM_DATA/mSMS.log. $HM_DATA is defined in your Env_system file

On ecgate, you can follow the progress of your $EXP run on $SCRATCH/hm_home/$EXP. More complete results data are available on C1A:$TEMP under $HM_DATA: $TEMP/hm_home/$EXP. Under this directory you will find:

   * All binaries under lib/ibmecmwf/bin
   * Model libraries, object files and source code under lib/gmkpack_build for GMKPACK-build and lib/bin for MAKEUP
   * Scripts, config files, sms and msms definitions under lib/
   * Utilities such as gmkpack, gl and verification under lib/util
   * Climate files under climate
   * Archived files under archive
   * Working directory for the current cycle under YYYYMMDD_HH
   * Verification data on ecgate:$SCRATCH/hm_home/$EXP/lib/util/monitor, also archived in ECFS: $ECLOC:/$userid/harmonie/$EXP/vfld
   * Log files (HM_Date_$cycle.html, HM_MakeCycleInput_$cycle.html and HM_Postprocessing_$cycle.html, under ecgate:$SCRATCH/hm_home/$EXP. All logfiles are also archived in ECFS: $ECLOC:/$userid/harmonie/$EXP/$YYYY/$MM/$DD/$HH

       * without surface assimilation 
       * with 'old_surface' surface scheme
       * with full DFI (fdfi) or "none" initialisation 
 * Points of attention regarding model configuration
     * Although combination of many configuration options are theoretically possible in terms of basic features such as data assimilation, coupling strategy, just a few combinations, which are perceived to be reasonable, have been tested in the course of implementation, such as reported in [wiki:Harmonie_36h1/ValidationTests the validation report about 36h1.3/36h1.4 ]
     * we discourage highly the use of ANAATMO=none option together with ANASURF=CANARI or ANASURF=CANARI_OI_MAIN. Use ANAATMO=blending instead
     * While running data assimilation, please make sure that you provide corresponding structure function that fit exactly to your model domain. Preferably you shall derive your own background error structure function in advance. A tool has been developed lately to "interpolate structure function" from other horizontal domains but with same vertical coordinate structure, but this is mainly for code test purpose.
       * Following sample sets of structure function are available on ECFS for a number of domains. Please follow the relevant hints in scr/includ.ass to download data for local experimentation
         * SCANDINAVIA (11 km): derived from ensemble runs with ALADIN physics and ECMWF ensemble data, 11 pts extension zone
         * SCANDINAVIA (11 km) with 63 pts extension zone: derived from ensemble runs with ALADIN physics and ECMWF ensemble data
         * SCANDINAVIA (11 km) + OLDSTRFUN: derived from downscaling runs with ALADIN physics (NMC method)
         * SCANDINAVIA_5.5: derived from downscaling run with L60 and ALARO physics and ECMWF ensemble data
         * SCANDINAVIA_5.5 + L65: derived from downscaling run with ALARO physics and ECMWF ensemble data
         * RCR_POLAR:derived from ensemble runs with ALADIN physics and ECMWF ensemble data, 11 pts extension zone
         * DENMARK (2.5 km with VLEV=65): derived from downscaling run with 36h1.1 AROME physics and ECMWF ensemble data
         * FINLAND (2.5 km with VLEV=65): derived from downscaling run with 36h1.2 AROME physics and ECMWF ensemble data
         * SWEDEN_2.5 (2.5 km with VLEV=HIRLAM-60): derived from downscaling run with AROME physics and ECMWF ensemble boundary
         * NORWAY: derived from downscaling runs with ALADIN physics (NMC method)
         * NORWAY_5.5: derived from downscaling runs with ALARO physics (NMC method)
         * IBERIA (11km):derived from downscaling runs with ALADIN physics (NMC method)
         * IBERIA_8 (8 km)derived from downscaling runs with ALADIN physics (NMC method)
         * IBERIA_2.5 (2.5 km): derived from downscaling runs with AROME physics and ECMWF ensemble boundary
     * Only conventional observation data are used as default, see [source:tags/harmonie-36h1.4/scr/include.ass scr/include.ass], although tests with use of remote sensing data have been done at several services (DMI, met.no, SMHI). Variational bias correction for AMSU data are applied by default. To avoid long 'spin-up' period with coefficients, a "warm start" option is applied, in which sample VRABC coefficients files derived by Roger R. at met.no are copied during initial cycles.
