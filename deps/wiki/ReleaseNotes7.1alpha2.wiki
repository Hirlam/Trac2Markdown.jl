== Highlights of Hirlam 7.1 alpha 2 ==

Hirlam 7.1 alpha 2 is the second tagged trial release towards [wiki:Hirlam_7.1 Hirlam 7.1]. The code includes following main updates on top of the [wiki:ReleaseNotes7.1alpha1 Hirlam 7.1 alpha1]:

 * A switch of the reference computation platform from ECMWF HPCD to HPCE;
 * A series of bug corrections on climate generation procedure. As a consequence, the data assimilation run using the targeted new RCR resoluton, RCR_7.1, is now possible;
 * Optional assimilaiton of LAND SYNOP humidity data;
 * Improvement of efficiency for some horizontal diffusion routines;
 * Correction to enable recovery of graphic user interface (GUI) for mini-SMS after exit;
 * Correction of physics switch during data input using asyncronous i/o (HGS);
 * Bug corrections to correct uninitialized variables.

That this tagged system is still named as an 'alpha' release instead of 'beta' reflects the fact that the currently assembled system is still an incomplete one compared to the target for 7.1, (e.g., the fully tested new surface scheme has yet to become an integrated part), and that neither the individual components nor the assembled system has been tested thoroughly. To help developers with code tests, a tagged model version containing the new surface scheme, [wiki:ReleaseNotes7.1alpha2newsnow Hirlam-7.1 alpha2-newsnow], is released simultaneously. [wiki:ReleaseNotes7.1alpha2newsnow Hirlam-7.1 alpha2-newsnow] is equivalent to Hirlam-7.1 alpha2 but with the addition of the new surface scheme. 

We encourage developers involved with preparation of components for 7.1 to use the current alpha release as much as possible until the next assembled code version is available. Please remember to exchange experiences and report
problems/bugs to fellow developers. Meanwhile, we do not encourage operational centers to adopt the current one for operational use.

== Description of the code and script changes ==

The system 7.1 alpha 2 contains code updates on top of the previous tagged version, 7.1 alpha 1. A detailed listing of these changes can be found in [https://hirlam.org/trac/log/trunk/hirlam?action=follow_copy&rev=4730&stop_rev=4668&mode=follow_copy&verbose=on wiki page]. The following lists provides some main highlights of the changes, including names of main contributors and version numbers of the changeset associated most closely with the update:

 * A switch of the reference computation platform from ECMWF HPCD to HPCE (Xiaohua Yang, [4711]);
 * A series of bug corrections on the climate generation procedure which eliminate known problems of data holes, missing data and round-off errors (Kai Sattler, [4678])
 * An ad hoc scheme Ã³n ECMWF platform to help reduce computation time needed for climate generation by recycling hl_bpf-files from common archive (Kai Sattler, [4678]);
 * Bug corrections to correct uninitialized variables (Jacob W. Poulsen, [4697]);
 * Improvement of efficiency for some horizontal diffusion routines (Toon Moene, [4704]);
 * Correction to enable recovery of graphic user interface (GUI) for mini-SMS after exit (Ole Vignes [4694]). To activate/re-launch a GUI, simply go the the work directory $HL_WD and launch
{{{
  $PATH/Hirlam mXCdp
}}}
 * Correction of physics switch during data input using asyncronous i/o (HGS) (Jan Boerhout, Ole Vignes, Jacob W. Poulsen [4689]);
 * Correction of dimensions for scalar variable SVAR in dynamics and initialization subroutines (Tomas Wilhelmsson, Xiaohua Yang [4688]);
 * Optional assimilaiton of LAND SYNOP humidity data (Jana Sanchez, [4684]);
 * Enhanced support for configuration on several platforms (Tomas Wilhelmsson, [4668],[4670],[4687])
 * Preliminary re-grouping of resolution-sensitive Env parameters (Xiaohua Yang, [4709])
 * A script cleaning to remove superfluous scripts such as those related to Optimal Interpolation scheme(Toon Moene, [4726], [4728])
 * Other minor bug fixes, code cleaning and corrections (Ole Vignes, Kai Sattler, [4675],[4690] etc.)
