= Introduction =

During a Wednesday afternoon session at the ASM 2007 in Oslo the status of the preparations for three coherent impact studies (CIS) was discussed.The outcome of the meeting was reported back in the subsequent plenary session. These are the minutes of the meeting.

= General =

The mailing list [[Color(blue, obsimpact@hirlam.org)]] has been created to communicate information and issues on all CISs to all participants by all participants. Please use it. [[BR]]

To assure that you have sufficient SBUs for your CIS experiments at ECMWF, please apply for Special Projects resources individually and as soon as possible.[[BR]]

XY will create a repository in the ECFS for storage of observation of all types included in the CISs at ''ec:/hirlam/cis/obs/<obstype>''.[[BR]]
A detailed description of this repository will be available in a wiki page shortly. You will be notified through the mailing list.[[BR]]

 == Observations ==

{{{
•	The Seawinds observations for the periods 25-07-2006 → 02-09-2006 and 20-12-2006 → 02-02-2007 have been
        generated and are ready to be included in the new repository (JV).

•	The Conventional observations for these periods will be obtained from the RCR archive in the ECFS (PD).

•	VAD profiles will be extracted from the CWINDE server at the Met. Office. Possible issues with the BUFR
        format will be solved by JV.

•	No change on the status of AMVs. BA will take care of their availability.

•	BA and PD will take care of ATOVS data. AMSU-A is ready AMSU-B will become available for upper channels.

•	OSI-SAF SST and Sea Ice Coverage (SIC) products will be made available by Met.no (OV).
}}}

 == Implementation == 

{{{
•	The RTTOV-8 and snow/surface scheme branch will be merged with the trunk before the start of the bias 
        corrections for AMSU-A/B.

•	The SST implementation for OSI-SAF SST+SIC products will be available before the summer.

•	An updated verification package will be available for off-line verification in the CISs (fall 2007) that 
        ensures the use of an identical set of observations from related experiments for the verification of the 
        forecast quality (KE). At a later stage inclusion of new observation types for verification 
        (BUOYs, AIREPs, …) will be considered.

•	Improved background screening will be used if and when it becomes available. At the moment there is 
        inconsistency between the σb used in the Jb-term and the σb used in the screening of observations (CG). 
}}}



= Arctic experiment =


{{{
•	This CIS should and will wait until the new snow-surface scheme, the new SST+SIC implementation and the 
        ATOVS assimilation over ice are judged ready (summer).

•	Preparations in the mean time will focus on the joint assimilation of ATOVS and MODIS AMVs (CG).

•	At some stage, investigation is needed to assess the limitations of the current structure functions in 
        the vicinity of steep orography (Greenland) with respect to the spread of observation increments (CG).

•	This CIS aims to benefit from preparations already made for the Atlantic experiment.
}}}


= Mesoscale experiment =

{{{
•	Denmark has made changes to the scanning strategy of their radar network. They will now be able to retrieve
        wind information (HV → KS).

•	Improvements to the Finnish radar operations are reported as well, also for the purpose of radial wind 
        retrieval (KS).

•	There is progress (unspecified) in the development by Gunther Haase of a radar preprocessing package for 
        common use that will become part of the Hirlam reference system in the future (KS)

•	No efforts have been made so far to collect observations of any type for this CIS.
