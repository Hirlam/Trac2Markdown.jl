= Mailman and exim4 =

Mailman is the system behind the mailing lists at [https://hirlam.org/mailman/listinfo].
Note that all administration of the mailing lists themselves should be done via the web
interface to mailman, and not by editing files on the server. The password for mailman
administration is in {{{~root/Mailman-site-password}}}.

Exim4 is the mail exchange system, responsible for handling incoming and outgoing mail.

Both mailman and exim4 are installed as software packages on the server:
{{{
root@hirlam:~# dpkg -l | grep mailman
ii  mailman                           1:2.1.14-3ubuntu0.1                     Powerful, web-based mailing list manager
root@hirlam:~# dpkg -l | grep exim4  
ii  exim4                             4.76-3ubuntu3.2                         metapackage to ease Exim MTA (v4) installation
ii  exim4-base                        4.76-3ubuntu3.2                         support files for all Exim MTA (v4) packages
ii  exim4-config                      4.76-3ubuntu3.2                         configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
ii  exim4-daemon-light                4.76-3ubuntu3.2                         lightweight Exim MTA (v4) daemon
}}}

However, they are not automatically integrated just because they are both installed as packages.

The master configuration file for mailman can be found in {{{/etc/mailman/mm_cfg.py}}}.

The top level configuration file for exim4 is {{{/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf}}}.
After this file is changed, one needs to do:
{{{
update-exim4.conf
service exim4 restart
}}}
There are also quite a few mailman adaptations in the files under {{{/etc/exim4/conf.d/}}}, mostly
along the lines described here: [http://www.debian-administration.org/article/617/Mailman_and_Exim4].
