= Subversion repository =

The subversion repository is nicely integrated into trac, at least for browsing etc.
But commit rights to the repository is not the same as rights in trac.

Subversion access rights are controlled by the file {{{/data/www/svn_access.conf}}}.

The subversion repository lives under {{{/data/www/svnroot}}}.
Take a look at {{{README.txt}}} before you do anything under this directory.
The message is that you should use {{{svnadmin}}} for administrative tasks.

Type {{{svnadmin help}}} for more info.

One exception is the {{{hooks}}} subdirectory. If you need to change how the hooks
work, you should look at the scripts in this directory. The sending of commit-mails
is done by the {{{hooks/post-commit}}} script.
