= Trac and Wiki =

The trac environment is found under {{{/data/www/trac_hirlam_env}}}.

The master configuration file is in {{{conf/trac.ini}}}.

The access control to these protected pages (SystemOnly) is in {{{conf/authzpolicy.conf}}}.
The rest of the pages are "open", ''i.e.'', controlled by the "usual" access rules, described [wiki:SystemOnly/WebServer/Apache here].

The trac wiki pages are stored in an sqlite (v3) database, in {{{db/trac.db}}}.

Note that many administration tasks in Trac can be done via the ''Admin'' button on the wiki pages,
if you have the proper rights (TRAC_ADMIN).

But for some tasks the command {{{trac-admin}}} is what you should use.
Type
{{{
trac-admin /data/www/trac_hirlam_env help
}}}
for more documentation on this command.
