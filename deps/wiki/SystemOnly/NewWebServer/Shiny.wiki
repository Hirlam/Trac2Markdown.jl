A virtual server '''shiny.hirlam.org''' has been set up to ease access to the Rstudio shiny
server listening on port 3838. Since the apache web server is already set up with proper
access control and since the ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) are already open in the DMI
firewall it is easier to route access to Shiny through apache than setting up similar
access rights for port 3838.

Take a look at /etc/apache2/sites-available/shiny if you want to know more about how it is done.
The interesting part is this:
{{{
  ProxyPass        / http://localhost:3838/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3838/
}}}
That is, access to/from the root directory of {{{http(s)://shiny.hirlam.org/}}} is redirected to port
3838 on the server. Thus, the shiny configuration files are unchanged, the real server still
listens and works through port 3838. What could be done is to change the access rights for
the shiny server to only accept access through localhost, to ''force'' all access through
apache. As it is now, access via hirlam.org:3838 also works to where the port is open.

The shiny server should automatically start on server reboot. The details can be found in
{{{/etc/systemd/system/shiny-server.service}}}.
