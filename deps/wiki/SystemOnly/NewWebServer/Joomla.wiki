= Joomla =

On the new server, we have only copied over the version from the old Ubuntu 12.04 server.
This means Joomla version 2.5.14, which is really outdated.  But unfortunately, attempts at
upgrading Joomla to version 3.X failed because the '''Docman''' module could not upgrade.

Joomla source code (and some attachments) can be found under /data/www/joomla.
Otherwise a lot of content exist in the MySQL database '''joomla'''.
This database was migrated from the old server to the new in this way:


{{{
oldserver# mysqladmin -u root -p joomla > joomla_20190807.sql
oldserver# scp joomla_20190807.sql newserver
newserver# mysql -u root -p joomla < joomla_20190807.sql
}}}

As noted under trac, svn and git the Joomla user database (in mysql) is used for
authentication also to those services (at least where the web server is involved).

NOTE: '''Do NOT''' upgrade Joomla 2.5.14 to 2.5.28 even if this is easy and looks like an innocent change.
It has been tried, but unfortunately, the encryption scheme for passwords (in the mysql database) will change
with this upgrade.  And the mod_auth_mysql module we use for authentication to the other services (trac, svn, git, etc.)
will '''NOT WORK''' with the new encryption scheme!
