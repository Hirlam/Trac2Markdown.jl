= NEW hirlam.org server configuration =

The server is physically located at DMI, but has now been upgraded to a 32-core
Intel Xeon? with 16? Gb RAM. It runs (64-bit) Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Long Term Support), also known as "Xenial Xerus" (or just xenial).

== Installation of software ==

The software package system on Ubuntu is based on Debian packages, see [https://help.ubuntu.com/16.04/serverguide/package-management.html]
for info on how to install packages. If you ''can'' install something as a package, please do that, as it makes future
upgrades much easier.

If you wonder what packages are installed on the system you can do: {{{dpkg -l}}} to list them all. This will give a lot of output.
A better alternative is to combine with grep. E.g., if you want to list ''installed'' packages connected to the Apache server, you could do like this:
{{{
dpkg -l | grep -i apache
}}}

If you want to see what is potentially available in the Xenial software repositories, you could do e.g.
{{{
aptitude search apache
}}}
or, alternatively (with slightly different output):
{{{
apt-cache search apache
}}}

Software not installed as packages have so far been put under the home directory of the root user ( {{{/root}}} ).
