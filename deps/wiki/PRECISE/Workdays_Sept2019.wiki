Michael Glinton can probably participate remotely for some session and Antoine Verrelle
Pierre Brousseau Metéo-France (maybe remotely for some session?)
At video conference : Per Dahlgren and Roger Randriamampianina
Some sessions Susanna Hopsch and Lars Berggren 




= Agenda =



Issues:

   
    Status of experiments and tests : 

    Physics final namelist options and status of reference alpha_2 

    SICE solution and results, possible quality of RCO

    Observation spin up and impact runs:

    AMV, AMSU A/B (MHS), IASI, GPS RO, GPS ZTD (and AMSU), (Blacklist new or old)

    Inclusion of local_obs from UERRA, CARRA, any other MF and SMHI, implementation and validation 


    EDA performance and quality and noise ?  

    cost issues of EDA and cost savings

    Update of structure functions (for beta version ?)

    Structure function computations in production 

    Any more Experiments needed ?, table of reference and periods

    
    Making an alpha3? version imminently for spin-up runs or near production (urgent)

    Making an beta  tag or beta version for production, what more needs to be validated

  
   

    Obsmon issues, ?

    Archiving parameters GRIB2 , tests and validation

    ODB(2) and archiving (as far as is ready)

    Diagnostic tools for production Operational monitoring tools, verification 

    Coordination of production SMHI-MF



  

    

= Tuesday morning: 9-12  Nordkoster 11/355

   
   Status of (ready or almost ready) experiments and tests

    and SICE solution and test

                      Ritsem 22/366 10-12

    Physics final namelist options and status of reference alpha_2

    Experiments needed, table of reference and periods (to be updated at the end of the week) 


= Tuesday afternoon 13.30-17  (Visjövalen 11-17 ) 

   Satellite inputs, spin-ups and bias coefficients, list and check re-cap

        (Possibly with MET as well)
   
   List of impact experiments, results and plans


   Observation input choices and impact studies done


   14.30 - 15.30 Common Video conference with CARRA (Nordkoster 11/355)

   1. Overall status of both projects

   2. Obs usage, including satellite

   3. Efficiency and optimization issues

   4. Output data, user interaction

   5. Overview and expectations on uncertainty estimation

   6. Summary on plans for validation/verification and data sets for that Observation inputs and impacts 

  

  Excursion to Linköping SAAB Arena 


= Wednesday morning 9-12  ( Almagrundet 24/151 and for the rest of the week )


    EDA results and noise problems 

    EDA choices, cost savings 

    EDA used for background statistics and communication with 3D-VAR 5.5 km (flow dependency?)
 
    EDA for operationalisation    (this session with Susanna Lars too?) (Martin for this session too )

    


  
= Wednesday afternoon 13.30 -17 =


    Inclusion of local_obs from UERRA, CARRA, any other MF and SMHI, status and plans and use

  Near real time updates of fetched data (some of the SAT, IASI and GNSS) (Any local data?)

      
  3D-VAR and CANARI and the MESCAN with also ECA&D, local obs

 





    Obsmon issues,? probably not much now, 

    
    GRIB2 archiving parameters], software and how to archive, scripts or sms changes needed ( with Ulf (and Martin) (and Susanna?) 

   Archiving parameters - possible thoughts on EDA content and model levels ( default EDA as deterministic and model levels only for analysis)

   SURFEX archiving  

   ODB(2) and archiving (as far as is ready) (with Per D (Roger?)




= Thursday morning 9-12 = 

   Continuation of issues from Wednesday

   MESCAN and SURFEX issues, quality control,


   Verification, monitoring, diagonostic software 

   Production monitoring

   Production SMHI/MF coordination , MESCAN SURFEX



   


= Thursday afternoon 13.30-17 =




   Updates of scripts and programmes 

    

   Making an alpha-3 tag or beta version for spin-up and near production, contents and time

   Making a beta version (for production ), what is needed and planning 
 
   Experiments needed, table of reference and periods

   Conclusions and actions
