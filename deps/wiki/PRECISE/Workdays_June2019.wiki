Issues:

   
    Status of experiments and tests 

    Physics final namelist options and status of reference alpha_2 

    10 m wind problem and SICE solution and test 

    Experiments needed, table of reference and periods

    Trunk changes and needed / expected changes

    Making an alpha-2 plus? tag or beta version for production 

    EDA and cost issues of EDA and cost savings

    Update of structure functions (for beta version ?)

    Structure function computations in production 

    Inclusion of local_obs from UERRA, CARRA, any other MF and SMHI, status and plans and use

    Data inputs (any choices), impact studies bias coefficients and spin-up

    Obsmon issues, backend number of files, but also how to use the front-end for us

    Archiving parameters or rather scripts for fields GRIB2 ( as far as is ready)

    ODB(2) and archiving (as far as is ready)

    Diagnostic tools for production Operational monitoring tools, verification 

    Coordination of production SMHI-MF



  

    

Tuesday morning: 9-12
