= Draft Agenda =



Issues:

   
    Final Status of experiments and tests : 

    Physics final namelist options and status of reference beta1



    Observation spin up and impact runs:

    AMV, IASI, GPS RO, 



    EDA performance and implementation

    EDA archiving and parameters

    Update of structure functions (for beta version ?)

    Structure function computations in production 

    Any more Experiments needed ?, table of reference and periods

    
   Making script for warm start

   Making script, job and SMS task for accumulation of 24 hour first guess precipitation 

   
   Making an beta  tag or beta version for production, what more needs to be validated

         
  Archiving parameters GRIB2 , tests and validation, archiving scripts/jobs and SMS tasks
    ODB(2) and archiving (as far as is ready)

    Diagnostic tools for production Operational monitoring tools, verification 

    Coordination of production SMHI-MF 

    Wednesday looks a bit cramped with issues so we need to decide which can be dealt with on Thursday. N.B. Michael is not here on the Thursday.



= Monday Afternoon : 12.30 - 17 Visjövalen  11/355

   Work on EDA issues and implementation 

   Adam, Per D, Martin, Esbjörn and Per , Semjon, 

   Satellite impact experiments maybe and discussion



= Tuesday 9-17 General Assembly, Grand Hotel, Norrköping city centre

See separate programme 


= Wednesday morning 9-12  ( Ritsem 22/366  and for the rest of the week )

    Physics settings and implementation, any remaining validation 
   
    EDA implementation and for operations , validation , 

    B matrix implementation 

   
   ( EDA used for background statistics and communication with 3D-VAR 5.5 km (flow dependency?)
 
      
   Making and implementing the precipitation accumulation script and job under sms

  
= Wednesday afternoon 13.30 -17.30 =


    Inclusion of local_obs from UERRA, CARRA, any other MF and SMHI, status and plans and use

  Near real time updates of fetched data (some of the SAT, IASI and GNSS) (Any local data?)

      
  3D-VAR and CANARI and the MESCAN with also ECA&D, local obs

   MESCAN and SURFEX issues, quality control,

   GRIB2 archiving parameters] (from EDA) ,  scripts or sms changes needed  

   Archiving parameters - possible thoughts on EDA content and model levels ( default EDA as deterministic and model levels only for analysis)

   SURFEX archiving  

   ODB(2) and archiving (as far as is ready) (with Per D (Roger?)


= Wednesday evening 18-22 SMHI Restaurant = 

Official GA Dinner

= Thursday morning 9-12 = 

   Continuation of issues from Wednesday

   

   Observation spin up and impact runs:    AMV, IASI, GPS RO,

   Making the beta1 version 

   Spin-up run(s) and production plans and schedule 


   Verification, monitoring, diagonostic software 

   Production monitoring

   Production SMHI/MF coordination , MESCAN SURFEX

   Making the warm-start script

   


= Thursday afternoon 13.30-17 =

  Any wrap up with the SMHI people

  Production related tasks, Obsmon and verification and monitoring of fields etc.
