== Agenda ==

Minutes, please see at the end.

=== Issues: 

Time step, investigation, tests, stability, spectral nudging, 
        Physics final namelist options

        10 m wind problem and SICE

        Experiments needed, table of reference and periods

        Making an alpha-2 version

        Inclusion of local_obs from UERRA, CARRA, any other MF and SMHI, how to do it

        Data inputs (any choices), impact studies
        bias coefficients and spin-up

        Obsmon issues, backend number of files, but also how to use the front-end for us
        
        Archiving parameters or rather scripts for fields ( as far as is ready)
        ODB(2) and archiving (as far as is ready)

        Diagnostic tools for production 
        Operational monitoring tools

        Coordination of production SMHI-MF


        
        
Monday am: Zheng Qi will arrive and meet with SMHI research about DA and impacts  
  
        
  
=== Monday afternoon:     Common session 13-17  (in the Pavillon)

       Time step and stability issues.

           Gathering of all the results and diagnostics

           Experiments to test remedies (DA options, structure functions, spectral nudging, diffusion?)

       Physics final choices of namelist settings
           
=== Tuesday morning:      8.30-12
       More on the time step issues

       Possibly spectral nudging and tuning experiment

       10m wind and SICE problem, tracking down if problem not found

=== Tuesday afternoon    13-17 please note that 13-15 in different room (Målilla house 24 or Klar house 11?)

       
       Possibly on GRIB2 output (to be checked) 

       Diagnostic software

       Production monitoring tool

       Coordination of production SMHI and MF

       More from the timestep issues and 10m winds

=== Wednesday morning 

       Satellite inputs, spin-ups and bias coefficients, list and check

           (Possibly with MET as well)

       Obsmon issues, data files and saving or not and batch option, front-end standard use and monitoring

=== Wednesday afternoon    13-17

       EDA results and choices

       EDA system, cycling, communication with 3D-VAR 5.5 km

       EDA for operationalisation

       Local data and which way to do it, CARRA, MF and SMHI as in UERRA, UERRA WP1 rescued data? 

            3D-VAR and CANARI and the MESCAN with also ECA&D, can we process CARRA OBSOUL files and write our own ones?

       Observation input choices and impact studies done
  

       

       Results of time-step and stability tests, more tests to do

=== Thursday morning and early afternoon
      
       [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uQQxZIR-gIJdjskXSoOM9MB_KwI4grCMXUqKYrp66Es/edit?usp=sharing Archiving parameters and direct output of GRIB2]

       Making and contents of an alpha-2 version        

       Making a list of priorities 

       Making a table of planned runs, reference and periods

       Tests of which configuration
