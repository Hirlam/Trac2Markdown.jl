= Draft Agenda =



Issues:

    Working practice when setting up experiments

    Final Status of remaining experiments and tests : 

    Results and status of the spin-up runs 1980 and 1983 and the near real time spin up 2019

    Activating remote sensing data in the streams, passive or not, how and when

    EDA spin up run

    EDA system - consistency with deterministic, technical issues and in particular the ecma obsmon files and how to handle them

    Update of structure functions (for production)

    Structure function computations in production 

   New more recent local obs

   Updating remote sensing recent data

   
   Making another tagged beta version for production, what needs to be in there?

  Handing over tasks from Esbjörn
  Going through tasks and organisation of change managagement and making releases
  Discussion about how to handle this 
         
  Archiving parameters GRIB2 , tests and validation, archiving scripts/jobs and SMS tasks

  SURFEX archiving 

  ODB(2) and archiving 

  Production schedules and plans

  Diagnostic tools for production Operational monitoring tools, verification 

  Coordination of production SMHI-MF 




= Tuesday morning 9-12 

    Introduction

    Working practice when setting up experiments and what is controllable etc. (Semjon and more)

    Any remaining validation and impacts of observations

    Activating remote sensing data in the streams, passive or not, how and when

    GPS-RO down to 3 km 

    Results from the spin up runs 1980- , 1983- and near real time run 2018

    EDA spin up run
   
    EDA implementation and for operations , 

       consistency with deterministic, technical issues and in particular the ecma obsmon files and how to handle them


    EDA validation - results
      
  
= Tuesday afternoon 13.30 -17.30 =

    
   B matrix implementation 
   
   EDA used for background statistics and communication with 3D-VAR 5.5 km (flow dependency
   
   Any other spin-off jobs to be integrated in the production ?

   Inclusion of local_obs from UERRA, CARRA, any other MF and SMHI, status and plans and use

   Near real time updates of fetched data (some of the SAT, IASI and GNSS) 

      
   Evening:
    Dinner to be decided 

= Wednesday morning 9 -12.30 =

  
   3D-VAR and CANARI and the MESCAN precipitation analysis with also ECA&D, local obs

   MESCAN and SURFEX issues, quality control,

   GRIB2 archiving parameters (from EDA) ,  scripts or sms changes needed/implemented

   Google doc of the archiving parameters  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHY857fbs5AU-3HeamMUk4m974aSfl5ARtC3PxSCLwk]

   Archiving parameters - any further thoughts on the contents 

   SURFEX archiving  

   ODB(2) and archiving (as far as is ready) (with Per D ) checking testing and implementation

   Probable new beta release and what components to go in
 


= Wednesday afternoon 13.30 -17.30 =



   Setting up full suite with EDA and with archiving 

   Spin-up run(s) and production plans and schedule 

   Verification, monitoring, diagonostic software 


Evening: 
  
  Common dinner in Toulouse with some special thanks !



= Thursday morning 9 -12.30 =

   
  Handing over tasks from Esbjörn

  Going through tasks and organisation of change managagement and making releases

  Production monitoring

  Production SMHI/MF coordination , MESCAN SURFEX

  Testing 

 

= Thursday afternoon 13.30 -15-17.30? =


   Results and conclusions

   Further actions
