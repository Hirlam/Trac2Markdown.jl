= ECFS directory tools =
`[`last modified: [[LastModified]]`]`

These are some scripts that help to manage directories under ECFS.
You can get information on how to use each tool by calling the tool
with the `"-help"` option. This will show the manual page for the tool.

== Important Note ==

Please be aware of the fact that the ECFS tools are very powerfull.
Especially with the removal tool ''edrm'' you can erase directory trees
completely and '''without possibility for undo'''. So please only use
these tools when you are in a sober condition.


== Tools ==

=== '''`edch`''' -- ECFS directory tree chgrp and chmod recursively ===

''edch'' can change the group ownership as well as the access mode of a directory
tree in ECFS. The latter is separated in access mode for the directory including
all sub-directories, and in access mode for all files under the given diretcory tree.

=== '''`edcp`''' -- ECFS directory tree recursive copy ===

''edcp'' can perform two actions:

  1. copy a directory tree recursively within ECFS
  1. copy a directory tree from disk recursively into ECFS

Note that the time stamps of the objects below the tree are ''not'' retained.

=== '''`edls`''' -- ECFS directory tree recursive listing ===

''edls'' lists the content of an ECFS directory recursively in a simple tree structure. The listing depth can be limited.

=== '''`edrm`''' -- ECFS directory tree recursive removal ===

''edrm'' removes a directory tree in ECFS recursively. This is a very useful and
very powerful tool, and it should be used with much care, because ECFS
does not support an undo option.

=== '''`edrs`''' -- ECFS directory tree restore and re-store ===

This tool can be used in two ways:

  1. you have a directory under ECFS and you want to copy it completely onto disk, while timestamps of all objects are retained.
  1. you have a directory under ECFS and you want to store it as an archive in one file and have it copied to another location under ECFS. The archive retains the original time stamps of the objects under the directory tree.

Both applications work for directories in ECFS with arbitrary depth of the directory tree.
