== Surface Data-Assimilation in HARMONIE ==

=== Training course Norrkoping September 2011 ===

HARMONIE has two different surface schemes. In sms/config_exp.h they are known as:

* old_surface
* surfex

The way that surface assimilation is performed is quite different depending on which scheme you choose to use. For old_surface, only one option exists and is called:

* CANARI

For SURFEX two options exist:
* CANARI_OI_MAIN
* CANARI_EKF_SURFEX
