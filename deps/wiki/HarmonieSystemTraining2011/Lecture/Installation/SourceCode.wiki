= Source Code (the Subversion repository) =
Once logged into your special user for performing HARMONIE experiments (e.g., 'harmonie'), do the following:

In your home directory:
{{{
mkdir svn
cd svn
svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/harmonie-36h1.4
}}}
This ensures that all source code extractions are grouped together in a subdirectory that's clearly marked for those by the 'svn' name.

Because of the rapid development during the 36h1.4 tagging, a change failed to make it: the configuration file needed to build gl_grib_api (gl using the GRIB API library for decoding GRIB).  This can be fixed as follows (grabbing the configuration file from the current 36h1 branch):
{{{
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/branches/harmonie-36h1/util/gl_grib_api/config/
cp ./config/config.linux.gfortran.mpi ~/svn/harmonie-36h1.4/util/gl_grib_api/config/
cd ..
rm -rf tmp
}}}
