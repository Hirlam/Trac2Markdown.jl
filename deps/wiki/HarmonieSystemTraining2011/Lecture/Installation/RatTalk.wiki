= Rationale For This Presentation =

The existing implementations of HARMONIE are complex - they need to be that complex to be efficient on the hardware they're running on.

What if the choice of hardware weren't important anymore - what if it were nearly free ?

Would you want to apply disk quota, a job queuing system, run time constraints, stack limits to such an important job ?

Of course not - that's why you run a Linux box at home - to do your [wiki:TOON_HIRLAM own thing] !

[ Note that this presentation also assumes that you actually make use of the features of a multi-user Operating System, and hence, create a separate user for running the HARMONIE system, e.g., 'harmonie' ]
