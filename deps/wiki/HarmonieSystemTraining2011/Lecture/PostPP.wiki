== Post-processing ==

This lecture will cover more advanced post-processing with two different tools, and might be too complicated also for the lecturer:-)

We will start by pointing to the wiki documentation on how to use gl for post-processing:
https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieSystemDocumentation/PostPP/gl

The other tool which is a part of the model source code and actually involves running the full model for the initial time step is called fullpos. We will go through the wiki documentation here:
https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieSystemDocumentation/PostPP/Fullpos
