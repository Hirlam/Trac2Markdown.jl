== Procedure for refunding of travel costs through MUSCATEN ==

MUSCATEN will pay all travel costs, accommodation costs and per diem for people from Nordic and up to 70% of these costs to people from
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for this training. All costs for the invited speaker worldwide will also be covered for. The per diem is however limited to 32 EUR/ day.

The easiest way to pay is an invoice from any institution to University of Tartu. The home institution of a participant may pay all his/her travel, hotel and per diem costs and send the bill to:

MUSCATEN[[BR]]
Marko Kaasik[[BR]]
Institute of Physics, University of Tartu[[BR]]
Riia 142 51014[[BR]]
Tartu[[BR]]
Estonia[[BR]]


'''Due to Estonian legislation, MUSCATEN cannot refund directly to a foreigner but each claim has to go through the institution of each participant. Make sure that you can arrange this with your home institute '''.

This is a VERY IMPORTANT information for all participants who apply MUSCATEN funding.

Some rules are changed due to amendments in Estonian financial regulations. I apologise that these changes are not included to MUSCATEN guidelines so far - I will do that very soon.

1. Direct payment of per diem by University of Tartu to any foreigner under any circumstances is not allowed anymore. It is possible to refund per diem to an institution.

2. Limit of hotel cost, earlier stated as 128 EUR per night, is lifted now - you are in principle free to expend as much as needed, if you get a relevant hotel receipt. However, I recommend to keep costs under control in general, but for this meeting 185 EUR per night is OK, as there is nothing cheaper available at reasonable distances.

NB! I strongly recommend the last option for all costs:
first the Nordic or Baltic institution pays the travel costs to its employee and then this institution presents an invoice (please attach photocopies of original travel documents and bills) to UT for refund. This scheme is equivalent to the one recommended for arranging the workshops (see below).
Direct reimbursement can appear delayed and uneasy.
