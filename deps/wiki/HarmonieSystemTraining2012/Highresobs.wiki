= The aim =

There is a lack of knowledge of the HARMONIE Forecasting system in HIRLAM community. This need to gain the knowledge becomes acute in
the light of the extensive code overhaul for data assimilation and
preprocessing of observations at ECMWF/MF (OOPS/COPE projects). This
code overhaul will lead to structural and algorithmic changes which
would penetrate deeply into the HARMONIE system within 1-2 years.

 = The emphasys =

This HARMONIE Training week would come as a natural continuation of
the HARMONIE System training working week arranged last year in
Norrkøping. The most attention will be devoted now on learning the
source code structures and on understanding the implemented
algorithmic developments(variational bias correction, construction of
pseudo-observations, observation error diagnostics, quality control
procedures)
