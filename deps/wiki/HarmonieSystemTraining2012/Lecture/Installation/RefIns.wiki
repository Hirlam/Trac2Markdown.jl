=== Configure and Launch Harmonie experiments from ECMWF-ecgate ===

At ECMWF HPC platform, by default, the mSMS script uses the front-end ecgate to configure and launch experiments, whereas C1A is used for all computations except those for operations related to observation verification and monitoring.

Following example shows steps to launch an Harmonie-37h1.1 experiment $EXP on ECMWF platform:

 1. Create an experiment directory under $HOME/hm_home and run the setup
{{{
   mkdir -p $HOME/hm_home/$EXP; cd $HOME/hm_home/$EXP      # the experiment name can be artificially chosen
                                                           # but it must not contain "."
   ~hlam/Harmonie setup           # this by default points the model version to the latest tagged Harmonie release; or

}}}
   * Modify specifications for model versions (ALADIN, AROME, ALARO), data locations, settings for dynamics, physics, domain, coupling host model etc. e.g,
{{{
   ~hlam/Harmonie co scr/include.ass         # retrieve default 3DVAR configuration script include.ass
   vi scr/include.ass                       # modify the script
}}}
 1. Launch the experiment
{{{
      PATH_TO_HARMONIE/config-sh/Harmonie start DTG=YYYYMMDDHH DTGEND=YYYYMMDDHH LLMAIN=24
                 # e.g., ~hlam/Harmonie start DTG=2008030500 DTGEND=2008030618 LLMAIN=24
                 # would enable you to run cycles starting from first one in 2008030500 and last one in
                 # 2008030618 as last cycle, every 6 h, with forecast length of 24h at 00 and 12 UTC, 
                 # and 6 h at 06/18 UTC
                 # if DTGEND above is not given, it will be assued that DTGEND=$DTG
}}}
If successful, mSMS will identify your experiment name, launch mXcdp and start build and run. If not, you need to examine the mSMS log file $HM_DATA/mSMS.log. $HM_DATA is defined in your Env_system file
