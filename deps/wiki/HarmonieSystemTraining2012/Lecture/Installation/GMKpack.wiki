== GMKpack ==

Gmkpack is the ALADIN utility to compile ARPEGE/IFS

 - Handle dependencies (includes/modules)
 - Handle exceptions
 - Compile the code
 - Build the binaries

A mainpack installs and builds a complete HARMONIE source (ALADIN/HIRALD/ALARO/AROME models). Generates a set of pre-compiled libraries (rootpack) and modules available for USE. 
Each single user builds their own local "target" pack, which synchronized local source modifications with the reference libraries.

Gmkpack is intended to be installed and maintained separately. In HARMONIE it is a part of the system and used in Build_gmkpack, Build_rootpack and Build_pack.

Sequence of tasks happening under mSMS in the GMKpack build:

- Build_gmkpack 
- Build_rootpack
 - rsync the sources from HM_REV, HM_CMODS, HM_LIB
 - cleanpack
 - compiles the ODB compiler
 - compiles IFS
 - locks the pack

- Build_pack
 - build everything in the OTHER_PROGRAMS list. This is done inside HM_DATA/gmkpack_build
 - build the utilities (gl/verobs/oulan)

When things goes wrong

 - ics_* can be run stand alone from the ROOTPACK. 
   - Turn off the compilation and linking
   - build the libraries by running the ics_* file by hand
   - BUILD_ROOTPACK=no, put the corrections to the failing code in your experiment
   - rerun Harmonie install
