=== Compilers and standard software ===

The system requires the following standard unix/linux software 

 * A fortran compiler
 * A C compiler
 * flex & bison for lex & yacc
 * ksh and sh
 * perl

Read more about the tested compilers under [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/Installation installation].

=== MPI and OpenMP ===

Harmonie supports parallelization through message passing or shared memory multiprocessing. 

 * mpi libraries such as mpich2, openmpi or similar.
 * OpenMP libraries

The system can also be compiled without support for MPI.

=== BLAS and LAPACK libraries ===

You need [http://netlib.org/ BLAS and LAPACK-lite] libraries.

If they are already on your system, verify they have been made with the correct compiler, or rebuild them. Instructions on how to (re-)build BLAS and LAPACK follow below:
 * Download [http://www.netlib.org/blas/index.html BLAS] and [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html LAPACK]
 * First build BLAS (untarring blas.tgz places it in the BLAS directory). Go to that directory, and edit make.inc to set the compiler and linker to '''gfortran'''. Then type 'make'.
 * Subsequenty, for LAPACK, after untarring lapack-lite-3.1.1.tgz, go to the lapack-lite-3.1.1 directory.
 * Copy make.inc.example to make.inc.
 * Edit make.inc to point to the proper compiler/loader ('''gfortran''') and to put the variable PLAT to the empty string. Set TIMER to INT_ETIME.
 * Copy the blas.a library from the BLAS directory to the lapack-lite-3.1.1 directory, run ranlib on it, then type 'make'.
 * Then copy the libraries in '''/usr/local/lib''' with names libblas.a and liblapack.a, respectively, otherwise the default configuration will not find them. Run ranlib on them.

=== NETCDF ===

 Netcdf is required for some routines. Make sure you have development version installed on your system.

=== GRIB, BUFR and auxiliary software ===

The software for reading GRIB and BUFR is included in the HARMONIE system an comprises

 * grib-api 1.9.9
 * bufr 000381
 * gribex 000370

In addition there are some extra support libraries.

 * dummies_001/2/3
 * eclite_001
 * rgb_001


If you compile with [wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/Build_with_makeup Makeup] these are built for you. If you use gmkpack you have to build them yourself. For grib-api follow the instructions. For the other libraries follow the instructions below. Read more in the [source:trunk/harmonie/util/auxlibs/README README file].

In each of the directories in auxlibs, run the script ./build_library.  You'll have to answer the following
questions:

 * Which compiler to use
 * Whether you want 64 bit reals (yes)
 * Where to store the library on completion of the build (choose a subdirectory of your home directory
   where you have write permission - note: full path; e.g. the GFORTRAN.LINUX configuration assumes these
   libraries are in $HOME/auxlibs and include files in $HOME/auxinclude)
 
After build_library finishes, run ./install - this will put the library in the directory you've chosen above. 

=== Perl requirements ===

To be able to launch the mSMS mXdcp window you need to have perl toolkit installed. Define PERL_TK and PERLTKDIR in your system config file.
