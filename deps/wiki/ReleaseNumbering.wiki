= '''''HIRLAM's NEW RELEASE NUMBERING SYSTEM''''' =

== Background ==

Since HIRLAM-5, releases of the HIRLAM system have been divided into official and beta releases. Official releases are normally well tested and validated with proven meteorological superiority compared to previous official ones. Beta versions are released between official ones to fix bugs and/or introduce new features.

== Current practice ==

The current HIRLAM version numbering scheme is of the form “major.minor.release”. The major number indicate the HIRLAM project (5,6..), and the minor number the '''last''' official release during that project. Official versions have “release”=0, whereas beta versions have “release”>0.  This is quite an unusual numbering scheme, and goes against expectations one might have from other software products.   It is a common assumption that, say, version 5.0.1 corrects errors present in 5.0.0, but that it doesn’t introduce any new functionality.  This was also the case for HIRLAM versions 5.0.1, and 5.2.3. 6.3.5a can also be considered to be a bug fix release. However, most other beta releases introduced new features.
 

== Principal ideas of the new version numbering system ==

The HIRLAM release numbering scheme in HIRLAM-A will be changed so that
 * Version numbers indicate the status and maturity of a release
 * Maintenance (bug fixes) releases and new feature releases can be distinguished.  
 * The quality and status of a release is more obvious from its name.  
 * That a release is a beta should be stated in its name. 
 * A version intended to become a new, official release should be called a release candidate (rc). 

As an illustration, ReleaseScenario for 2006 lists a '''fictive''' release scenario.

== Relation to revision control system ==

Subversion is now replacing CVS as HIRLAM's revision control system.

Previously, a new beta release was often made to in order to distribute a new feature for further testing by the member states. Subversion users a global revision number for the whole project; each update to one or more files will increase the revision number for all files.  This gives a unique handle for new revisions of the software. One can say for instance, “NOAA-27 was added in revision 4347”, or “vectorization of phys was completed in revision 6754”. A developer may then easily retrieve this particular revision. If there is a need to release something that is far from becoming official it should be called beta or even alpha.  For instance:

   "7.2 alpha1	Snow scheme: please test"
