The autumn HARMONIE Working Days of code development and HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR 2015 will be hold this year in Reading, on the premisses of the ECMWF, during week 48, Monday - Thursday, the 23rd of November - the 26th of November. The topic of the Working Days is the integration of the HIRLAM algorithmic developments into the IFS modelling environment. The development of the meso-scale data assimilation system is one of the strategical priorities of the HIRLAM consortium. The HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR is the HIRLAM baseline development for data assimilation on convection-permitting scale. A number of alternative algorithms for flow-dependent data assimilation are considered. The ECMWF has kindly agreed to extend the HARMONIE Working Days with one day of the collective discussion on joint code development with the ECMWF and LAM partners involved.

= Aim of the Working Week =

 The main objective of the HARMONIE Working Days is further development of HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR : assure stable technical performance, evaluate of meteorological performance of the HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR and continue implementation of high-resolution observations (radar data, GNSS, Mode-S) HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR. 

 The integration of the HIRLAM algorithmic developments into the common codes is an additional topic of the HARMONIE Working Days. The HIRLAM and ALADIN consortia are developing scientific codes jointly within the common IFS code environment. This requires maintenance and coordination of a very complex system what creates a challenging situation for all partners involved. Several algorithmic developments are of high interest for several partners (4DVAR, (L)ETKF, Hybrid, VarBC), and development of these algorithms should be done in a coordinated way. The IFS modelling environment undergoes a deep overhaul and restructuring of the codes to guarantee that the software infrastructure remains competitive and powerful on future computer architectures. We see the OOPS as a software infrastructure for future NWP and integration of new developments into the OOPS system is an important issue for us. On our side we have to assure that HIRLAM algorithmic developments are  carried out in  compliance with the OOPS-imposed IFS/Fortan code refactoring, and that proposed OOPS design supports all needed functionalities. 

 The procedure/guidelines on how to introduce new data assimilation algorithms (and extend functionalities) into the existing system OOPS are needed, and we propose this topic for the collective discussion on Friday, the 27th of November. Amother question to be addressed is a possible contribution from the HIRLAM side to the OOPS imposed IFS Fortran code re-factoring.  The current practise of contribution from the HIRLAM side is not very efficient. It leads to multiple re-implementations of the developments in the changing code environment. This complicates a lot our possibility to contribute meaningfully to the scientific development of the codes and in addition weakens motivation for our team. We are interested to discuss (and to plan eventually) possible  HIRLAM contribution to the IFS Fortran code refactoring on the tasks which is in line with our code developments (more flexible VarBC, additional optimization constraints, TL/AD models in relation to AROME 4DVAR, projection to the observation space and (L)ETKF) and possibility to implement our scientific developments on the latest code releases.

= IFS Fortran code refactoring =

 The test environment for observation operator refactoring was developed at ECMWF (Alan Geer). The test harness, HOP_DRIVER, calls the observation operator and generates FG departures without calling any model code or initialising any model modules. Firstly, the IFS is used to dump a single-observation GOM_PLUS to file from the 1st trajectory of an experiment. Dumping multiple observations would require a more complex and full-featured dump (good file format, multi-process parallel). For code refactoring HOP_DRIVER can be used to test changes to the observation operator of a particular observation type. Local implementation of the HOP_DRIVER environment in Harmonie (based on CY42R2: https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/branches/refactor/harmonie) and the documentation ([wiki:HarmonieSystemDocumentation/ObservationOperators HOP_DRIVER Test Environment]) is provided by Eoin Whelan. The example with the  AMSU-A (HOPOBS=amsua) single observation experiment is available for testing with HOP_DRIVER.
