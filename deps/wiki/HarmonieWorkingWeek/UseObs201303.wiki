= Status on the extended radar data impact studies =
 * For the baseline experiment (conventional data + ATOVS) Magnus (6 hour update cycle) and Sigurdur (3 hour update cycle) are spinning  up VARBC coefficients based on the latest (December 2012) release of CY37 (CY371.2). The spin-up period !20100614-!20100731;  The experiment period !20100801-!20100828. 

 * IASI data: have been tried at met.no passively under CY371.1 (temperature and water vapour sensitive channels), however run is unstable ; some technical problems may still remain if MARS archived IASI data are to be used; implementation of IASI data must be adapted to CY371.2. The VARBC coefficients need to be warmed up. 

 * radar data: the latest radar data pre-processing developments (Martin Ridal work on HDF5 format and the variable scanning strategy) are implemented in CY37h1.2. The local implementation of the common quality control tool (BALTRAD Toolbox) is still problematic at some national institutes. The algorithm for de-aliasing of the radar wind velocities is expected in the latest  release of the BATRAD QC Toolbox.  We still have only vague understanding about how the quality control flags set up by QC tool are transmitted to variational data assimilation via CONRAD + BATOR using MF BUFR format. Beam blockage maps must be generated for each radar. The German radar data format with an extensive QC control are still not converged to MF BUFR format.

 * GNSS data: the VARBC algorithm for GNSS data is implemented in the CY37h1.beta.2 (must still be phased into CY37h1.2), the adaptation of ODB to extract the VARBC information for GNSS (treated as SYNOP observations) is still to be done for CY371.2. The severe positive bias for the humidity measurements extracted from the ZTD GNSS is the most probably due to the HARMONIE pre-processing of GNSS data in ASCII format (high precision geoid projection is needed). The most of countries are involved into the COST action (GNSS4SWEC).        

 * ASCAT wind data: scatterometer data are working technically in CY37h1.beta.2 at ECMWF. The implementation must be phased into CY37h1.2. 

= Purpose =
 *  to provide an update on the status: the local experience at the NMS's in implementing and assimilating high-resolution high-frequency observations in HARMONIE; 

 *  to address the relevant scientific questions:
  -  1)    what are the relevant predictors for VARBC correction of radiances over small LAM domains; 
  -  2)    what channels are meaningful to a assimilate in the low top HARMONIE model over small size domains; 
  -  3)    performance of the cloud detection scheme; 

 *  to take up and hopefully solve the remaining technical problems: 
   -     the consistency and the relevance of the radar data QC flags provided by the BALTRAD QC Toolbox,  required in DA and allowed by MF BUFR format;
   -     the HDF5 format and humidity/reflectivity profiles in radar data assimilation; 
   -     the de-aliasing of the radar radial wind velocity; 
   -     the implementation of the beam-blockage map in the obs.opr.;
   -     the severe positive bias of the ZTD GNSS in HARMONIE in ASCII format (obs. preprocessing/ obs.operator/ …); 
   -     the VARBC for ZTD GNSS, the ODB and the active ZTD GNSS assimilation in CY37h1.2; 
   -     the IASI data flow in CY371.2 and various BUFR formats;
 
 * to discuss important strategical questions: 
   - 1)  the coordination of the feasibility test for radar data exchange: the BALTRAD “life” data stream; what “foreign” data do we want to have,  are we able to read “foreign” radar data locally, are we able to interpret “foreign” radar data correctly, are we able to apply to them QC locally ; 
   - 2)  the dedicated action groups: how to implement the idea in practise; 
   - 3)  the dedicated research efforts on the assimilation of the advanced high-resolution observations: define framework for the scientific collaboration (University of Hohenheim); 
   - 4)   the coordination of the extended radar data impact studies : the verification of results (how, whom, what verification data)
   - 5)    HIRLAM and the ODB:   how to improve the knowledge in the ODB developments and from where can we get experts;
   - 6)    the optimal configuration of the DA system for (very) short range NWP;
