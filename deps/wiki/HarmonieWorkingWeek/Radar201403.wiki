= Status on the usage of radar observations in Harmonie =

= Purpose =

Basic Idea is to have user driven working days where we can share experiences, present results and ongoing work as well
as discuss problem and work on solutions.
The major points to discuss are:
 
  * Pre-processing of radar data 
  * Go through the HDF5 code step by step to understand and improve it
  * Remaining technical questions in the assimilation
  * Quality control
  * Radar data exchange and content of the OPERA files
  * Coordinated impact study
  * Radar data assimilation in 4D-Var
  * Radar data assimilation at ECMWF
  * Minimum detectable signal (using the radar constant and sensitivity)
  
Conclusions and suggestions to future work regarding these points can be found in ... in the Attachments.

= Agenda =

== Wednesday 12 March (Presentations, Discussions  technical session) ==
  * 09:00 - 11:30 : Status reports

Wim: Still using KNMI HDF5+conrad, converting Belgian data to KNMI hdf5. Planning to change to use ODIM HDF5 with help of Martin's code.
Impact study (radar and no-radar) using ECMWF computers.
To study the development of small scale structures, small 2d model with different friction spectra was used.
- several impact studies in different cases
- changing update frequency to study aggrgeating effect of assimilation, gradually to RUC

Mats: Assimilating 8 times a day. Directly using HDF5 no Conrad. Radar upgrade coming. Update of hdf5 format this year, high resolution. Fixing the found errors. Using almost all data in domain from ftp server (not Estonia and Korpo, though. British data wished but not available.). On good day 40+  radars for reflectivity and 20+ for velocity. 
System is behaving with this load. 
# Daniel (and later Elena) to approch UKMO about the status

Velocity sign (positive towards or away) is different for different radars, has been defined in ODIM 2.2. but will take time to be implemented.

All QC filtered, and reducd to 2 km. Differences in formats we need to discuss.
Identified typical situations which go beyond all QC (hardware issue).

Elena: starting. problems with reading data.

Sigurður: starting. just copied Icelandic radar data from ftp to ecgate

Martin: assimilating 12 swedish 8 norwegian radar, excluding lowest elevation. 
Now in blacklisting (not hardcoded any more). Quality flags tranlated to French flags. Norwegian comes in polar MF-BUFR. Offset and gain are missing, CONRAD using this. 

two week in August 2011, 3 weeks in december-january
reflectivity neutral to positive
radial wind - negative to neutral
combined - negative to neutral

Only standard verification used so faar, need to do SAL and case studies

Not yet started: super observations, radar sensitivity (assimilation of clear sky). Daniel has old superobbing code which can be recycloed.

Wim and Elena are working at ECMWF computers, Sigurdur would like to start very soon.


== Thursday 13 March  (Presentations, Discussions  technical session) ==
 
  * 09:00 - 10:00 Discussions and work.
  * 10:00 - 11.30 Video meeting with Mate Mile, Hungary and Michal Nestiak, Slovakia
                  Mate showed a presentation with their experiences with the INCA QC. He also showed some results from assimilation experiments. How to collaborate and compare results was discussed.  INCA has 7 indexesfor  radar quality control Q1 Laplace, Q2 RLAN, Q3 Attenuation, Q4 NWC SAF, Q5 Beam blockage, Q6 Radar climatology and Q7 collects all of these. Baltrad toolbox has similar to these, but not the NWC SAF (satellite based), and the attenuation one is not in use. INCA collects "raw" HDF5 from members and central QC. They have experimented blacklisting everything below 1 km, which helps with spinup but decreases impact. They have interesting verification parameters such as average intensity of the objects, domain average precipitation.

  * 12.30 - 15:00 Discussions and work
  * 15:00 - 16:00 Nils Gustafsson: Jb-statistics

== Friday 14 March  (Presentations, Discussions  technical session) ==
  * 09:00 - 10:30 : Discussions and work. Ulf solving issues with running experiments at ECMWF computers. Magnus discussing the 4DVAR. 
  * 13:00 - 15:00 : Final Discussions and Wrapping up!
