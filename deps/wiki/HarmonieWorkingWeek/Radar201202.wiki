= Outline =
 == Discuss implementation of the common radar data QC ==
      * introduction into the BALTRAD QC toolbox;
      * introduction into the production QC software (PRORAD, met.no)
      * contraints imposed by the real-time  data exchange 
      * implementation of the common QC toolbox in the way consistent with actions taken during the screening and the assimilation steps; 

 == Investigate the current status of the technical implementation of the radar data assimilation flow at National Institutes ==
      * the real-time data exchange: CONRAD tool
      * the status of BATOR software : polametric volume data with regards to MF BURF format
      * the progress/the problems with technical implementation of the radar data at KNMI, AEMET, SMHI, DMI, met.no (Germany)

 == Propose the optimal configuration of the radar data assimilation set up for 2.5 HARMONIE ==
      * first impact studies of radar radial winds and the radat reflectivity at HIRLAM/HARMONIE (met.no)
      * RUC experiences (3h/1h versus 6h)
      * flow-dependent structure functions
      * initialisation of moist processes and spin-up of balances
