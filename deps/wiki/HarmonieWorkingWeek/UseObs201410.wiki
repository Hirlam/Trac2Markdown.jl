= '''Harmonie DA&UO Working Week 2014''' =
'''AEMET (Santander), 13^th^ - 16^th^ October 2014'''[[BR]]
The HARMONIE Working Week on DA&UO will be held this year on the premises of the Regional Office of the AEMET, in Santander, week 42, the 13^th^ October - the 16^th^ of October, 2014. The topic of the WW is the tuning of the HARMONIE DA system for the optimal use of the high-resolution high-frequency observations for meso-scale NWP. 2015 is the last year of HIRLAM-B. We have to synthesis together our experience and produce a data assimilation system suitable for meso-scale NWP by the end of 2015. HARMONIE Working Weeks is our main forum for an exchange the experience, to asking and to answering questions, and it is an important stage in planning the research activities...

= Use of High-Resolution Observations in HARMONIE =

 In HARMONIE consortia we have experience with different high-resolution observations (IASI, Mode-S, ZTD GNSS, radar data, cloud products, SEVIRI images, scatterometer winds, ...), but we have little understanding how to combine all these data sources into an efficient data assimilation system. Limitations of the data assimilation methodology, for example climatological structure functions, data quality, deficiencies of the model itself (systematic biases) and the complicated relations the between model state and the observed quantities (remote sensing observations) certainly impact how efficiently we are able to use different data sources. However, as our experience with assimilation of ZTD GNSS shows, the tuning of the data assimilation system, namely how close one comes to observations, can give a lot. 

 = The status of the algorithmic developments in HARMONIE =

 At present HARMONIE AROME 3hRUC 3DVAR is the default configuration for meso-scale data assimilation in HARMONIE. The experimentations with HARMONIE AROME 1hRUC 3DVAR are on-going and are quite promising. HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR is technically working with conventional data (2 hours data assimilation window, 20 minutes observation window) and is able to outperform HARMONIE 3DVAR 3hRUC in a number of scores. More extensive evaluation is on-going. The work on introducing of the high-resolution data sources (Mode-S, GNSS, radar data) into HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR is on-going. The use of high-resolution observations in the 4DVAR context immediately lead to a new problem: how to account for spatially and temporally correlated observation errors. There are also stand-alone developments in HARMONIE which goes beyond the variational framework with climatological structure functions: the Cloud Mask Initialisation from the MSG products and the Hybrid of FA+3DVAR for assimilation of radar data.

 = The purpose of the WW =

The main topic of the working week will be the overall tuning of the HARMONIE data assimilation system (HARMONIE 3DVAR 3h/(1h?) RUC, eventually plus stand-alone developments) on the efficient use of high-resolution observations (Mode-S, ZTD GNSS, radar data, scatterometer winds, IASI (?), GNSS RO(?)) on meso-scales: observation error characteristics, effective model resolution and thinning, what scales are meaningful to analyse, optimal configuration of RUC setup (what update frequency and what types of observations), impact of structure functions.
  
During the Working Week we would like 
  * to provide the overview of the current status on the use of high-resolution observations in HARMONIE
  * to define a number of impact studies experiments in order to  measure/understand the impact from the dufferent data sources in a systematic way
  * to provide an overview of the existing diagnostic tools (o-b/o-a statistic, innovation based diagnostics for correlated innovation errors, analyses of energy spectra, ect)
  * to introduce the stand-alone developments integrated into HARMONIE system (Cloud Mask Initialisation and Hybrid FA+3DVAR for radar data assimilation)
  * to get an overview of the existing verification tools in HARMONIE
  * to provide an overview of the current status for the development of the common IFS/HARMONIE pre-processing system (COPE)  
  * to provide a brief introduction into OOPS/IFS and challenges of LAM OOPS HARMONIE,  the our future working environment

By public transport (bus):

1) From Bilbao Airport to Bilbao City Centre: Bus to City Centre (go to !TermiBus stop) It is the last stop and it is the Central Bus Station.. Line A3247.
There are buses each 30 min and they cost around 1,45 euros. You have to pay to the bus driver.

2) From  Bilbao Termibus (city centre) to Santander(city centre): ALSA Bus to Santander. (www.alsa.es)
there are buses from 7:00 to 23:15 h , each 30 min to Santander Bus station. It takes around 90 min.
