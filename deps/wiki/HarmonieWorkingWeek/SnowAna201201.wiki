 * Jelena Bojarova, Mariken Homleid and Trygve Aspelien (partially), met.no

== Agenda

 * HIRLAM experience in assimilation of GLOBSNOW data

 * technical implementation of GLOBSNOW data in HARMONIE based on the HIRLAM experience

 * accounting of horizontal cross-correlations within GLOBSNOW data and between GLOBSNOW and SYNOP data in CANARI

 * impact of new types of snow data on the HARMONIE forecasting system (local precipitation stations + satellite data (GLOBSNOW) )

 * consequent treatment of snow measurements in CANARI and SURFEX (computation of snow density)


== Outcomes

  1. Sea-ice modelling and data assimilation: Regarding surface data assimilation and modelling, the  emphasis on the “Northern” challenges is the strategic division of tasks between HIRLAM and ALADIN. The sea ice modelling and data assimilation are seen therefore as the strategically important area of the HIRLAM-B responsibility.  We propose at the first stage  concentrate on the implementation of a simplistic single layer sea ice model in the SURFEX, similar as in HIRLAM. The implementation of the advanced HIGHTSI sea ice model will be taken on the longer timescale perspective (low priority this year). With regards to introduction of a simplistic single layer sea ice model, a wide “home” experience at met.no and DMI (analysis of SST and sea ice concentration from OSI SAF products), SMHI ( DAMOCLES project: HIRLAM + HIROMB, the coupled atmosphere/ocean/sea ice model system) and FMI (special data from Baltic sea) should be utilized. Mariken will go through available methodology at home institutes and will study it. Katya is prepared to assist transiting  the HIRLAM code into HARMONIE framework. Mariken is responsible for implementation. Because the sea-ice coverage  is a  very in-homogeneous field, the introduction of sea-ice fraction in CANARI is the first priority task. A way how to introduce the sea-ice fraction into CANARI and how to relate it  to SURFEX will be discussed during the SURFEX data assimilation WW in Toulouse (5-6 March). Katya proposes to arrange a side meeting with Erik Martin.  
 

 2. GLOBSNOW SWE product: GLOBSNOW SWE product is of coarse resolution (the grid-size of 25km), it seems that the signal SWE is smoothed even stronger. The estimation of SWE equivalent is based on the variational solution of radiative transfer equation where the first-guess field is the SD, kriging from the SYNOP stations to the EASE-grid, transformed to the SWE using monthly climatological snow density values. The original idea was to  introduce SWE product into HIRLAM forecasting system as a “SYNOP” type SD observations. Following problems are observed: undesirable use of SYNOP observations twice (this could be avoided modelling SYNOP-GLOBSNOW cross-correlations), uncertainty in modelling/estimation  of snow density (snow density seems to be a too high on average). It  seems that  small amount of snow is overestimated and large amount of snow is underestimated in GLOBSNOW product.  In the data sparse areas unrealistic snow structures are produced. Suleiman (RHMS through FMI) was engaged in the this work (independent PhD study) but at the moment he is attracted to other tasks. It is decided at the moment to put a lower priority to the assimilation of SWE GLOBSNOW product (manpower problem). The way forward would be to try the introduction of SWE product directly without transforming it to SD, however it is still questionable how much additional information these measurements could bring on the meso-scales. Katya and Suleiman produces a final report on feasibility of GLOBSNOW product for synoptic/meso-scale data assimilation. A  more proper alternative to assimilate GLOBSNOW product, but more time consuming, would be the direct integration of the method into the HARMONIE data assimilation system, avoiding in such way kriging of SYNOP SD measurements.

 3. Snow measurement from precipitation stations: Mariken has done the technical work which allows to bring in other types of observations into the HARMONIE forecasting system : ASCII-> OULAN-> OBSOUL-> BATOR->ODB. The study of an impact of these additional snow measurements over Norway is ongoing. Kalle will investigate availability of similar data in Finland. The most problematic situation in snow data assimilation is the lack of “no-snow” measurements what cause a too late melting of snow. An alternative could be to use SCE measurements. Mariken will investigate possibility to use snow probability maps  product at met.no. Kalle will investigate the usefulness of NESDIS data (following methodology  developed at ECMWF ). Kalle will also check the status of the LandSAF products of snow cover. This product is based on geostationary satellites (potential problem in high latitudes), but similar product from polar orbiting satellite is coming.
 
 4. The one-layer snow scheme in SURFEX (D95) is currently used by default and in all snow analysis experiments. The modelling of the Snow Water Equivalent seems to be realistic. The snow analysis is performed in two steps; the SWE field is updated by OI in CANARI followed by an update of all SURFEX snow fields in OI_main. It is very important that the update in OI_main is consistent with the treatment of the fields in SURFEX. The one-layer snow scheme is now, with a final bug fix related to the snow density and albedo fields, updated properly in CANARI+OI_main.
 
 5. Important improvements with respect to temperature is expected from the 3-layer snow scheme (3-L) in SURFEX. Technical testing of the 3-L scheme will be carried out in 2012. The necessity to prevent inconsistence between CANARI and SURFEX fields and how to do it will be taken up during March WW on Surface DA in Toulouse.

 6. Next surface data meeting is planed on late May-early June (Oslo or FMI).
