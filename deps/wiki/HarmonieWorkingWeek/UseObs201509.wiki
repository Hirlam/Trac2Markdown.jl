The HARMONIE DA&UO Working Week 2015 will be held this year on the premisses of the Met Eireann, the Irish Meteorological Service, in Dublin, week 37, the 7th of September - the 10th of September 2015. The topic of the WW is the strategy and tactics of further development of the HARMONIE data assimilation system to acquire efficient use of high-resolution observation in the near and moderate future. December 2014 the joint meeting of HIRLAM and ALADIN Steering Bodies took place the merge the HIRLAM and the ALADIN consortia into one consortium was decided from year 2020. This decision will impact the scope and the strategical priorities of the HIRLAM-C programme (2016-2020). HARMONIE Working Weeks is our main forum for an exchange of experience and knowledge, to asking and to answering questions, and is an important stage in defining strategy and planning research activities.

== The IFS Fortran codes re-design and re-structuring ==
 The purpose of the IFS Fortran code re-factoring and re-structuring is to obtain a modular, efficient, transparent, easy manageable and powerful NWP system. The IFS/OOPS system replaces the present administrative Fortran layer based on the "global variables" principle with the C++ Object-Oriented administrative layer. Even if the intention is to keep the scientific codes unchanged, the IFS/OOPS redesign is a challenging and efforts demanding investment for the ECMWF and the partners.  It induces rewriting of large pieces of the IFS Fortran codes making the evolution of the common codes unstable. The HIRLAM consortium is interested to contribute to the redesign and refactoring of the IFS Fortran codes in the areas which coincide with the HIRLAM scientific priorities. For the HIRLAM side, the involvement into the common work should help reducing the gap in code evolution and should provide the scientists with the possibility to implement scientific ideas only once in the latests code releases, avoiding reimplementation. This will lead to a more efficient use of resources and strengthening of motivation. MF is going to lead the observation operator re-factoring efforts. The observation operator refactoring mini-workshop took place in Toulouse 1-2-3 July, where the aspects of the scientific planning and the coordination of collaboration were addressed. It would be beneficial for all sides if efforts on the Fortran codes refactoring at the ECMWF and the efforts on the algorithmic developments on the HIRLAM side would be well coordinated and would use advantages of each other on overlapping tasks.

== Deficiencies of the HARMONIE Variational Data Assimilation system ==

 The HIRLAM-B programme put dedicated efforts on assimilation of high-resolution high-frequency observation. Although the obvious progress has been achieved, the number of deficiencies of the HARMONIE variational data assimilation were outlined which prohibit an efficient use of high-resolution observations on meso-scales. The climatological structure functions with imposed homogeneity and isotropy are the main drawback of the 3D-Variational data assimilation system; At present HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR optimized for short data assimilation window (below two hours) is considered as a base-line development for flow-dependent data assimilation methods in HIRLAM consortium. Improved treatment of large scale errors, physically meaningful balances, correction of for non-additive errors are the areas where further algorithmic development are necessary. There are several on-going algorithmic developments in HIRLAM consortium aiming to improve efficiency of data assimilation on meso-scales, and some of them have developed outside the HARMONIE variational data assimilation. It would be an advantage to integrate these developments into the joint variational framework on long term perspective. It is important to analyse consequences and put priorities for the algorithmic developments in HIRLAM consortium, considering the challenge of the common code evolution and the requirements for powerful data assimilation system for convective-scale phenomena at the same time. At present, the double work might be unavoidable.
  
== The purpose of the WW ==

 The main aim of the WW is to setup priorities for further algorithmic developments needed to obtain a powerful data assimilation system on convective scales. During the WW we would like 

 - provide the status overview of the data assimilation of high-resolution observations in the HIRLAM consortium and collect the plans for 2016;
 - exchange experience and share knowledge concerning pre-processing and assimilation of remote sensing and in-situ observations relevant on convective scales;
 - refine the assimilation of "the high-priority observations" (radar data, Mode-S, GNSS, ...) in the context of HARMONIE AROME 4DVAR   
 - provide the status overview and the plans for collaborative efforts in COPE (common pre-processing tool)  and OOPS (data assimilation system)
 - analyse the consequences and put priorities for the algorithmic developments in HIRLAM consortium for 2-5 years period   
 - define and plan HIRLAM contribution to the IFS/HARMONIE Fortran code re-factoring and re-design

 We would like to use the opportunity of the physical meeting among the staff, and reserve two days of the WW for the technical work in groups to address important technical questions.
