== Highlights ==

Hirlam 7.1 rc 2 is the second release candidate for the upcoming official reference system [wiki:Hirlam_7.1 Hirlam 7.1]. The system includes bug corrections and a slight tuning in physical parameterization on the first release candidate, Hirlam 7.0 [wiki:ReleaseNotes7.1beta3 rc 1]:
 * A tuning in condensation scheme STRACO to improve winter-time precipitation.
 * A correction to a script bug which had effectively excluded the re-forecast scheme in operational scenario.
 * A bug correction to avoid unrealistic growth of wind maxima at model top.
 * Other minor code/script improvements and corrections. 

Except for the winter time wind maxima events appearing at HIRLAM model top (ca 10 hPa), the overall meteorological impact of the current release ( 7.1 rc2) is considered small compared to the previous release candidate ( 7.1 rc1 ) for similar situations. For winter time precipitation, improvements have been observed for tested episodes.

== Description of the code and script changes ==

The system 7.1 rc 2 contains numerous [log:trunk/hirlam#4958:5001 code modifications] over that of the previously tagged version  [wiki:ReleaseNotes7.1rc1 rc 1]. The main changes include:
 * Further STRACO tuning ([4996], Sass) with the aim to correct on the tendency of over-reduction of the winter time precipitation in rc 1. 
 * Script bug correction to revive re-forecast scheme in operational scenario with 6-hourly ECMWF BC boundaries ([4968], Eerola).
 * A bug correction to the algorithm in the semi-Lagrangian interpolation scheme by which the wind maxima increases unrealistically in case of model top wind maxima ([4984], !McDonald). 
 * Other technical corrections
   * correction on archiving option ([4966], [4992], Eerola)
   * improvement on verification graphics ([4972], [4973], [4977], Eerola)
   * script changes related to ensemble forecast option ([4959],[4962],[4974],[4975], Sattler)
   * correction on 4D-VAR option ([4963], Yang)
   * other bug fixes, corrections ([4967],[4971], [4978], [4993], [5001], etc., Eerola, Poulsen, Vignes, Wilhelmsson)

HIRLAM developers are welcome to participate in system test and evaluation to help improving the system. The official release of Hirlam 7.1 is scheduled to be made later this month.
