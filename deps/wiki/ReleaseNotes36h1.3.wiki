== Highlights of Harmonie-36h1.3 ==

HARMONIE-36h1.3 is released on 23 December 2010. 36h1.3 is the first official version of the meso-scale HARMONIE[[FootNote(HARMONIE is the acronym for Hirlam's meso-scale forecast system (Hirlam Aladin Regional/Meso-scale Operational NWP In Europe). The HARMONIE model is developed jointly by the European consortia HIRLAM and ALADIN through the HARMONIE project: Hirlam-Aladin Research towards Meso-scale Operational NWP in Europe.)]] forecast system released by HIRLAM.

Harmonie-36h1 code-series as maintained in HIRLAM's system repository is an adaptation to the IFS/ALADIN Cycle 36T1 and the subsequent 9 bugfix versions, with the aim to serve the needs for both operational as well as research applications in the HIRLAM community. At its default, the official release 36h1.3 features a meso-scale forecast system with convection-permitting AROME physics, 3D-VAR upper air assimilation, and an optimal interpolation-based surface analysis, on a model grid with 2.5 km grid-spacing in horizontal and 65 vertical levels. Harmonie-36h1.3 also includes a comprehensive set of scripts and utilities supporting various optional components and applications.

The decision to declare [source:tags/harmonie-36h1.3 harmonie-36h1.3] as an official release has been made with following reasoning
 * that [wiki:Harmonie_36h1/ValidationTests extensive validation efforts ] have been made to test and evaluate the main components and options from both technical and meteorological aspects. Among these, numerous inter-comparisons have been made to examine performances of HARMONIE forecasts in different weather situations, and results so far indicate that, qualitatively, HARMONIE-36h1.3 provides competitive forecast skills to those of comparable operational HIRLAM systems
 * that the chosen default settings for HARMONIE-36h1.3, appear to behave adequately in comparison to other featured alternative options in physics, data assimilation, build and boundary preparation schemes
 * HARMONIE-36h1.3 as a quality-assessed meso-scale forecast system contains main components targeted by the 5-year HIRLAM-A programme which now ends. Through the official tagging, HARMONIE-36h1.3 now serves as a technical and quality benchmark for future HARMONIE system series.

Harmonie 36h1.3 bases its source code on cycle 36T1 and the subsequent bug fixes (up to bf9). In addition, it includes 
 * Hirlam's local source code updates including those options for an improved physical parameterisation, code optimisations
 * a comprehensive set of system scripts to help users to adapt for various platforms/applications, such as those for build, running testbed, experimentation with domains, assimilation options (3D-VAR, 4D-VAR, CANARI, CANARI-OI-MAIN), forecasts with ALARO/AROME/ALADIN physics, different coupling methods, and post-processing and diagnosis such as for monitoring and verification
 * a comprehensive set of utilities, among them, the build tool based on gnumake (MAKEUP)
