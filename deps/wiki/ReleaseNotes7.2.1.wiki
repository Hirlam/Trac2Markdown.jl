== Highlights of 7.2.1 ==

Hirlam-7.2.1 is a bug correction release over the current official Hirlam reference system, [wiki:Hirlam_7.2], which switches the default computer platform at ECMWF HPC from HPCE to C1A. In addition, it ports several system updates and bug corrections recently installed in the developing versions for Hirlam-7.3.

Hirlam-7.2.1 replaces Hirlam-7.2 as the current/official Hirlam reference release.

Overall the meteorological impact of the update is estimated to be minor, which is limited primarily to the correction about lateral boundary data interpolation [6736].

The complete source code of Hirlam 7.2.1 can be obtained by using either

 * Subversion command
{{{
   svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/tags/hirlam-7.2.1
