== Highlights of Hirlam 7.1 alpha 1 ==

Hirlam 7.1 alpha 1 is the first tagged version of [wiki:Hirlam_7.1 Hirlam 7.1]. The code includes following main features targeted for [wiki:Hirlam_7.1 Hirlam 7.1]:

 * A resolution increase in both horizontal and vertical, from the current reference model grid mesh with 438x348 at 0.2 degree resolution and 40 levels, to a grid mesh with 538x440 at 0.15 degree resolution and 60 levels;
 * An upper air data assimilation based on incremental 4D-VAR;
 * An upgrade in CBR turbulence scheme with parameterization of moist processes, a tuned STRACO condensation scheme adding parameterization of cloud ice;
 * A recoded physics parameterization package for CBR, STRACO and radiation schemes which is in phase with the "HIRLAM parameterization package" that was phased into the ALADIN/IFS;
 * A statistical-balance structure function derived with NMC method;
 * A updated climate generation, version 7.1, which features parameters needed for mesoscale and subgrid scale orographic effects parameterization (MSO/SSO);
 * Configuration to perform experiments on the new ECMWF computer platform HPCE.

In addition, HIRLAM 7.1 is also targeted to include source codes/scripts for features as listed below. The timeline in the brackets are the current estimated time of introduction:
 * An upgrade in surface scheme; (Dec 2006)
 * Options to assimilate AMV and MODIS data; (Oct 2006)
 * Options to assimilate surface relative humidity data; (Oct 2006)
 * Implementation of RTTOV 8 radiative transfer module and the algorithm to derive bias correction accordingly; (Oct 2006)
 * First outcome of the HIRLAM-A code cleaning and system overhaul; (Oct 2006)
 * Optional inclusion of climatological index field and Eady index to account for heteorogeneity of background error structure function; (Nov 2006)
 * Optional inclusion of facility to assimilate OSI-SAF SST and ice data; (Feb 2007)
 * Parameterization of MSO/SSO and radiation over sloping surface; (Feb 2007)
 * Enhanced post-processing in forecast model to enable more diagnostic parameters; (Oct 2006)
 * Enhanced graphic software to present verification data (Oct 2006)


That this tagged system is named as 'alpha' release instead of 'beta' release, reflect the fact that the currently assembled system is still an incomplete one compared to the target for 7.1, (e.g., the new surface scheme has not been merged in), and that neither the individual components nor the assembled system has been tested thoroughly.

We encourage developers involved with preparation of components for 7.1 to use the current alpha release as much as possible until the next assembled code version is available. Please remember to exchange experiences and report
problems/bugs to fellow developers. Meanwhile, we do not encourage operational centers to adopt the current one for operational use.

== Description of the code and script changes ==

The system 7.1 alpha is an upgrade on top of the last official HIRLAM release, Hirlam-7.0. The changes in source code and scripts are quite extensive. These changes have been introduced gradually in 57 individual subversion "changeset", from changeset [4573] on May 6 2006 to changeset [4665] on Sept 27, 2006. A detailed listing of the code changes can be found in [https://hirlam.org/trac/log/trunk?action=stop_on_copy&rev=4665&stop_rev=4573&mode=stop_on_copy&verbose=on wiki page following the link here]. The following lists provides some main highlights of the changes, including names of main contributors and version numbers of the changeset associated most closely with the update:

 * Introduction of the new RCR gridmesh, RCR_7.1 with increased resolution at 0.15 degree in horizontal and 60 levels in vertical (Xiaohua Yang, [4641]). The new model domain is named RCR_7.1 while the current RCR domain is refered to as RCR_7.0. The choice of model domain is made in the script "Env_expdesc"
 * A number of important bug corrections for 4D-VAR options, most important of them in calculation of cost function gradient for weak constraint DFI (Nils Gustafsson, [4617]) and bug correction in tangent linear projection of 4D-VAR analysis increment for specific humidity (Magnus Lindskog, [4591])
 * Introduction of statistical balance structure function and the corresponding scaling factors. (Nils Gustafsson, [4639], [4653])
 * Moist CBR and tuned STRACO including parameterization of cloud ice, all coded in IFS-compatible fashion (Bent H. Sass, [4629])
 * IFS-compatible radiation code, and small technical modifications. The interface for radiation on sloping surface (Laura Rontu, Sami Niemela, Nastya Senkova, [4603])
 * [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/ClimateGenerationUpgrade_7.1 Climate generation upgrade for Hirlam-7.1]. It includes e.g. MF-MSO/SSO parameter aggregation. Accordingly, the HDF file data base for the climate generation has been updated. (Kai Sattler, [4588]). Note that the change in climage generation for 7.1 now causes a significantly longer execution time the first time the climate generation is performed for a certain domain, at a given platform
 * Implementation of re-forecast scheme, LSMIX, for 4DVAR and for non-default initialization schemes (Xiaohua Yang, [4619])
 * Revival of RCR-parallel boundary strategy to take into account the re-forecast scenario using LSMIX, (Kalle Eerola, [4593])
 * Increased resolution request for initial and lateral boundary data from the ECMWF MARS archive (Xiaohua Yang, [4657])
 * Adaptation of observation pre-processing to adjust the changed data format for TEMP Mobile data after June 7 2006 (Xiaohua Yang,[4614])
 * Code and scripts cleaning, ( Tomas Wilhelmsson ''et al'' [4574],[4578],[4579],[4584],[4585],[4586],[4587])
 * Reduced print-out messages in boundary interpolation and observation handling, (Xiaohua Yang, [4649])
 * Unified naming conventions for subroutine names by which all upper case subroutine names become now lowercase, the postfix .f becomes .F (Tomas Wilhelmsson [4604])
 * Bug fixes, such as re-introduction of parallel execution of boundary interpolation work, request for more memory for single PE boundary interpolation at ECMWF, elimination of race condition in 4D-VAR with LSMIX (Ole Vignes ''et al'' [4597], [4610])
 * Configuration to enable runs on ECMWF HPCE platform (Ole Vignes, [4660])
