The meeting will be held at the AEMET office on the Campus de Tafira, of the University
of Las Palmas. AEMET is 10 km from the city center of Las Palmas G.C.

The address of AEMET Canarias is:
C/ Historiador Fernando de Armas, 12 (Tafira Baja), 35017 Las Palmas G.C.

= Objectives =

The goals of the workshop are to inform each other of all the work that has been done so far on the high resolution (100-1000m) modeling and nowcasting, streamline all the work in HIRLAM-C that is going to be done, to pose the questions for research, not only for physics, dynamics and nowcasting but also for other important areas (surface, EPS, system) and to do some practical work.

= Presentation and discussion subjects =

 

* AROME, HARMONIE-AROME and ALARO HR model configuration (dynamics and physics)
* HR experiences in past two years since Copenhagen workshop
* Applications in mountain meteorology, airport applications, convective scale events, impact of urban effects
* Observation and validation studies, comparison with LES, temporal and/or spatial HR observations
* 3D physics at high resolution (radiation, turbulence), dependence physics on horizontal and vertical resolution
* HR research topics dynamics
* Assimilation aspects (methods and observations): e.g correlated observations; DA cycling strategy; superobbing/supermodding; initialisation techniques
* Nowcasting: how to get model close to observations
* Uncertainty and computation of B-matrix
* Surface and physiography aspects (resolution and surface types)
* Code optimization
* HR diagnostics and postprocessing
* Recommended HR setup(s) and HR EPS setup (2020 deliverable HIRLAM-C project; can we build a playfile?)

= Practical information =

Below there are two hotels (80-90 euro per night), close to each other and in a nice area and with convenient transport to the meeting venue are recommended. We recommend these hotels as they are of good quality and because when the whole group is staying in one or two hotels it makes the common transport to the meeting venue, e.g. with taxi buses, possible. Please use your own favorite booking tools for hotel reservation.

These hotels are (Please use the link for group booking special price)
* NH Imperial playa [https://www.nh-hoteles.es/event/harlem-aladin booking]
* NH Playa Las Canteras[https://www.nh-hoteles.es/event/hirlam-aladin-consortia booking]

= Transport to Las Palmas from the airport =

For information regarding the transport from the airport to Las Palmas, please check de website with [https://www.grancanaria-airport.net/transport.php information from the airport of Gran Canaria]. You can go by bus (with one transfer to get relatively close to the hotel) or take a taxi (around € 25).

= Transport to meeting venue =

Use the Guaguas global line 328 (they are blue, turquoise buses guagua is the local word for bus) 
* From NH-hotel (near 1 in figure 1 left) go to the bus stop in Albareda street (near 2 in figure 1 left) in front of the Port market.
* The bus leaves at 7:10, 8:10 and 9:10. It takes about 35 minutes to get to the University. I propose to catch the bus at 9:10 on the first morning, then we can see if we can stick to the earlier schedule on the next days or if we have to change it a little bit (e.g. due to breakfast times in the hotel etc.).
* Price € 1.40 per trip. You have to pay in cash, so it is best to carry some coins. There is also the option to buy 10 travel vouchers at a kiosk or at the bus stations.
* Once at the University you have to get off at the general library stop (see figure 1 right). From the library to the DT AEMET it is a short walk of less than 5 minutes.

= Coffee and lunch breaks =

The coffee breaks will be held at the university residence (self paid, see figure 2 left). The lunch breaks will be at the Aulario (Classrooms space, self paid, see figure 2 right). A typical lunch includes first course, main course, desert and one drink and costs € 6. A big table has been reserved at 1AM for our group.

= Tour of the old city =

For Wednesday afternoon (weather permitting, but we should be able to see if it is feasible or if we should postpone to Thursday) we propose to have a relaxed stroll through the old town (Vegueta) and the Triana area (pedestrian street with shops and restaurants). It is relatively easy to get there by bus from the university (get out at Vegueta). After this we propose to have a common dinner at Las Lagunetas, a nice restaurant near the old town.
