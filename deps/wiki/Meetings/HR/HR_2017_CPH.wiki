= Objectives =

The goals of the workshop are to inform each other of all the work that has been done so far on the high resolution (100-1000m) modeling, streamline all the work in HIRLAM-C that is going to be done, to pose the questions for research, not only for physics and dynamics but also for other important areas (surface, data-assimilation, EPS, system) and to work on the setup of two testbeds.

= Presentation and discussion subjects =

 

* HARMONIE-AROME and ALARO HR model configuration (dynamics and physics settings)
* applications in mountain meteorology, airport applications, convective scale events, impact of urban effects
* observation and validation studies, comparison with LES
* 3D physics at high resolution (radiation, turbulence)
* assimilation aspects (methods and observations)
* surface and physiography aspects (resolution and surface types)
* code optimization

= Work Session, 6 Dec 2017 =

* Create harmonie-HR branch to start joint work on High Resolution setup
 * A harmonie-HR branch is created, branching off from trunk version of HARMONIE.
 * At user's own platform, make your own sandbox (copy of the resopitory)
{{{
   svn co https://svn.hirlam.org/branches/harmonie-HR
}}}
 * Note that this branch is a moving one, do following to update your sandbox
{{{
   cd $directory_of_the_sandbox
   svn update
}}}
 * At ECMWF, following steps get you started
{{{
    mkdir -p ~/hm_home/DK750
    cd ~/hm_home/DK750
    ~hlam/Harmonie setup -r ~nhz/HR_repository/harmonie-HR
    vi sms/config_exp.h                                # to select own DOMAIN
    ~hlam/Harmonie start DTG=2017120300 DTGEND=2017120312 BUILD=yes
}}}

= Practical information =
    
DMI is located in Lyngbyvej 100, 2100 Copenhagen, close to Ryparken S-train (stog) station on the A, Bx and F train lines. Just make sure that you take it in the right direction, tickets are available from vending machines in the stations. 

Note that DMI canteen does not accept foreign credit/debit cards, thus only cash.

On Monday evening we propose a group dinner at a Chinese restaurant [http://diamond-rice.dk/ Diamond Rice ], Bredgade 29, in downtown Copenhagen. The Restaurant is close to Kongens Nytorv. The dinner will be a combination of a few small Chinese dishes in Cantonese DIM SUM style, combined with main course of Sichuan style. Participants pay for their own cost of 250 DKK which includes a glass of wine or beer or soft drinks. Participants pay for their own cost.
