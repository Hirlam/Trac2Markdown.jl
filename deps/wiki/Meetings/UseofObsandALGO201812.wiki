== Practical Information ==
Isabel Informed us about:
1) She made a group reservation at IBIS, Parque das Nações hotel. If you decide to stay at IBIS, please consider the following rates:
  - Single Standard Room including breakfast – 65.00€ / room / night
  - Double Standard Room including breakfast – 71.00€ / room / night
  - City Tax – €1/pax/night

2) IBIS Hotel reservation conditions:
You should complete the Hotel form in the attachment (CCTEMPLATE_PAGAMENTO_TERCEIROS_IPMA.PDF) and send it directly to the hotel by e-mail (H8501-AM@accor.com). The e-mail should be directed to Mr Sérgio Mendes and should mention that it is IPMA group reservation.

3) IBIS Dead line for reservation: 09/11/2018

4) From the IBIS to IPMA, you will have to take public transportation (3 stops taking the underground, red line). The Metro’s Red line connects IBIS (Oriente) to IPMA (Aeroporto), and then you have to walk for about 5 minutes (see att DiagramadaRedeMLjul2017.PDF).

 More to know:

1) In the following link you can see how to get from the hotel to IPMA:

2) In the following link you can find information about Lisbon underground (ticket prices and Map) https://www.metrolisboa.pt/en/

3) Closer to date, Isabel will ask you to choose the menu and she will reserve meals at IPMA’s Cantina (for those who wish to have lunch there). However, if you have any dietary constraint please let me know in advance.

 If you have any question at all, please feel free to ask Isabel (only about accommodation) & Roger
