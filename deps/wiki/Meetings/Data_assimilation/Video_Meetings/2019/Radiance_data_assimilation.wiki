== Topics of meeting: ==

=== Actions from Previous Meeting: ===

 - **Action-2 from the earlier meeting**: (On use of allsky radiances) MET is further on track (MET Norway will start working on this this year), MF (published the paper on the implemented approach).[[BR]]
    - **Roger** mentioned that there plan to use the IFS physics with tasks in 4D-Var as described [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/data_assimilation_plan here] (see the aprt on "Cloudy radiance").  [[BR]]
    - **Philippe** mentioned that MF is also thinking about this solution in ARPEGE 4D-Var.[[BR]]

 - **Action-1 from previous meeting**: (on possibility of considering land data in the VarBC constraints).[[BR]]
    - **Vincent** explained that there are land-related predictors. One need to check in the description. We found the following: 'view angle (land)' (pred16); 'view angle **2 (land)' (pred17); and 'view angle **3 (land)' (pred18), for example.[[BR]]

 - **Action-2 from previous meeting**: (on **Philippe** to report about the impact of ATMS radiances in the ARMOE-Fr model)[[BR]]
    - **==> kept** and **Philippe** mentioned that they are working to include NOAA-20 data in ARPEGE. They found good impact on the analysis. Better impact than that of NPP-1.[[BR]]

 - **Action-3 from previous meeting**: (on Roger to check how the use of mask file in HARMONIE-AROME DA).[[BR]]
    - **==> kept** and **Roger** reported that they tested the assimilation of MARS ATMS data using the mapping technique used at Meteo France, but the observed failure in Bator in both CY40 and CY43. Thus exercise will be restarted soon. [[BR]]

 - **Action-4 from previous meeting**: (on **Mats and Roger** to clarify how the superobbing of ATMS is done at DMI)
    - **==> kept**

=== Implementation of new satellites: ===

    - **Philippe** reported that they have the Metop-C data under test at MF. He mentioned that some channels have higher noise than that of Metop-B. Both Metop-C and NOAA-20 data are in preop at MF.[[BR]]
    - **Magnus** implemented the Metop-C microwave data in !MetCoOp. Spinup of the VarBC coefficients is ongoing. [[BR]]
    - **Magnus** also reported that he succeed to have the assimilation of FY-3C (MWH-2) data working in Harmonie. While Metop-C data will be test strait in preop regime, FY-3C data will be more investigated before operational application. Magnus is working with CY43 and MWH-2.[[BR]]
    - We asked the coefficients files for the Fy-3C instruments from **Philippe**. He said that one can get the coefficients from the SAF-NWP page. **Roger** mentioned that the available coefficients are either with 54 or 101 levels. **Vincent** said that RTTOV-12 considers to use higher levels and we can use other coefficients than with 44 levels. Just we need to perform interpolation. RTTOV documentation provides guidance on with interpolation mode is worth to use. At MF 54 levels coefficients are used for microwave data and 101 levels are used for infrared (IASI & CrIS). It's worth to consider coefficients with band correction.[[BR]]
    - **Roger** mentioned that recently the format of FY-3C data was changed. Bator needs to be updated. **Frank Guillaume** have the needed changes. [[BR]]
    - For MWH-2 assimilation, some changes needs to be done for CY40. Consider the satID 522...[[BR]]
    -**IASI-Metop-C:** ECMWF, MetOffice and MF are testing the data now. In case of positive outcome, IASI data dissemination can start the last week of May. To assimilate these data, one needs just to copy the coefficients for the Metop-B IASI.[[BR]]

=== Microwave instruments: ===

    - See above
    - **Sigurdur** asked if MF is using Atlases also in the assimilation of AMSU-B/MHS data. The answer from **Philippe** was yes. 

=== Infrared instruments: ===

    - **Roger** mentioned that they are looking at use of different NBG number in PRECISE for IASI assimilation. PRECISE uses the Euro-cordex doamin, which is relatively larger than the LAM domains we use to work with. Using the default NBG (2000) seems to produce too fast convergence of bias to the nominal one. He asked if someone observed similar problem/issue.[[BR]]
    - **Vincent** said that this is not an issue for them since they are able to use the coefficients from ARPEGE for most of the radiance data, except for Seviri.
    - **Roger and Benedikt** mentioned that Patrik Benacek and Mate Mile compared the efficiency of locally computed and ARPEGE VarBC coefficients in LAM assimilation. Paper on this work was submitted. According to this study, locally computed coefficients seem to be better for LAM assimilation.[[BR]]
    - **Vincent** reported about the fact that for both IASI and CrIS radiances they apply the inter-channels correlation, which have very good and positive impact. The inter-channels correlation was estimated using the Desroziers et al. approach. The observation error are kept unchanged, only the inter-correlation values are used. Furthermore, he reported that inflated estimated observation error gives similar results compared to the operational system. Non-inflated observation errors gives worse results, conformal to Bormann et al results. This implementation is now in the E-suite at MF (using CY43_T2). This approach was implemented in CY42. To activate this solution, one need to add reading of the inter-correlation values in defrun.F90.[[BR]]
    - **Vincent** also mentioned that they use land surface temperature (LST) retrieval in both ARPEGE and AROME to assimilate more channels over land. This approach can be also activated in our systems. This can be done the following way: 1) Read the Atlases; and 2) activate the logical keys. It was also mentioned that this process is very similar to activating the use of the Atlases with dynamical emissivity assimilation for microwave data.[[BR]]
    **==> Action-2**: On **Vincent** to provide to the group the location of the Atlases at MF.[[BR]]

    - **Vincent** mentioned that CrIS data from NOAA-20 via EUMETCast have different resolution compared to the old CrIS data. But, by the end of this year, same format will be used. If we wish to start the assimilation of CrIS data, he suggested to start with the NOAA-20 data.[[BR]]

      

=== MTVZA-GY: ===

    - MF tried to work on this instrument, but they stopped the work due to few reasons: the data have long timeliness, some of the channels have large bias, and data are not available...[[BR]]

=== AOB: ===
    
    - **Benedikt** asked help to monitor Seviri data through the Obsmon. [[BR]]
     **==> Action-3** on **Magnus** to provide guidance on how to proceed with Seviri radiance monitoring with Obsmon. [[BR]]

 * Philippe Chambon
 * Sigurdur Thorsteinsson
 * Eoin Whelan
 * Jana Sanchez
 * Erik Gregow
 * Alena Trojakova

== Topics of meeting: ==

* ** Actions from Previous Meeting:** (see below or [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/UseObs201605 the WW page])

 

 - **Action-1**: MF found bug in VarBC in the way it's applied in AROME. 2 microwave sensors (GMI & MWS-2 FY-3c used the predictor using 5- 10 hPa data. They will correct it. In Harmonie we don't use this predictor.[[BR]]
  - Regarding the use of ARPEGE model above the AROME model top, the modification is not yet done. It will be done before IRS from MTG. It's more important for IRS, since the simulation of certain channels is not possible otherwise. Some channels are sensitive in stratosphere and troposphere.[[BR]]

 - **Action-2**: MET is on track (more info below), MF (see below the update from Philippe).[[BR]]

**Microwave instruments:**[[BR]]

 **AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS radianes:**[[BR]]
  - **MWH-2** - From first of April up to now, EUMETSAT reported about geoplocation issue. It has impact in the operational system at MF. Data are now blacklisted.[[BR]]
  - **ATMS** - The is now new ATMS on board NOAA-20. Trial data dissemination are available in April.[[BR]]
  - **MWR/I** - MF started to receive these data.[[BR]]
  - **AMSR** - MF keeps working on this instrument.[[BR]]
  - **Joan** reported that he observed a decrease of number of available data in the morning assimilation times. New blacklist and VarBC are needs to be prepared.[[BR]]
  - Maneuver of NOAA-18 by NOAA-20. Keep reading the new! (see the posted mail in the Annex).[[BR]]
  - **Roger** observed strange changes in bias for channel 9. Maybe it it's due to the diurnal bias in the AROME-Arctic model.[[BR]]
  - **Jana** was interested in Patrik's method for VarBC computation. **Alena** promised to ask Patrik to answer the e-mail.[[BR]]
  - **Sigurdur** showed the results from testing the dynamical emissivity and Atlases in Harmonie. **Philippe** said that in hretr.F90 there is control about where to use the dynamical or Atlases solutions [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/arpifs/op_obs/hretr.F90 see the code]. He asked statistics about the use of the different solutions in our implementation. For that he is interested in the statics of emis_fg, emos_retr and emis_atlas. He mentioned that Florian showed [http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/itwg/itsc/itsc21/program/posters/7p.05_suzat.pdf such stats at the last TOVS conference].[[BR]]

  - **Action-1 to Philippe** to look at the possibility of splitting the VarBC over land & sea.[[BR]]

 **ATMS radiances:**[[BR]]

  - **ATMS** - The is now new ATMS on board NOAA-20. Trial data dissemination are available in April.[[BR]]

  - **Action-2 on Philippe** to report about the impact of ATMS radiances in the ARMOE-Fr model.[[BR]]

  - **Action-3** on Roger to check how the use of mask file in HARMONIE-AROME DA.[[BR]]

  - **Action-4 on Mats and Roger** to clarify how the superobbing of ATMS is done at DMI. [[BR]]

 **All sky radiances at MF:**
 - **Philippe** reported that the implementation of the Bayesian retrieval technique for All-sky Megha-Tropiques data in ARPEGE is ongoing and he needs to finalize the dedicated thinning. Separate thinning distances is applied for clear sky and cloudy area DA. This was tested by GMAO and resulted better impact. ECMWF uses superobbing for All-sky up to the resolution of 3rd outr-loop.
 - **Philippe** mentioned that the implementation of ECMWF version of All-sky assimilation will need to figure out the use of ECMWF physics.

 **MTVZA-GY radiances:** it's as SSMI/S like instrument, but the activity failed (???).

**Infrared instruments:**[[BR]]

**Seviri radiances:** [[BR]]
 - ** CrIS radiances:** New data from NOAA-20 will be available soon.[[BR]]
 - ** IASI radiances:** **Vincent** have good impact of accounting the inter-correlation error between channels. This was done using the same number of active channels. This will likely to be in the next MF parallel suite.[[BR]]


**Annex: Mail received by Philipp from EUMETSAT**[[BR]]
Dear Members of the STG-OPS Working Group,[[BR]]
We plan to start a trial dissemination of NOAA-20 EARS-ATMS Sensor Data Records (SDRs) on 3 April 2018.[[BR]]
The product format is the same as the operational S-NPP EARS-ATMS products and the filenames follow the same pattern – see: https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Data/RegionalDataServiceEARS/EARSATMS/index.html.[[BR]]
The products are currently generated at the Athens, Kangerlussuaq, Lannion, Maspalomas and Svalbard stations.[[BR]]
They will be distributed on EUMETCast Europe, on channel NPP-2 (PID: 500, Multicast address: 224.223.222.2).[[BR]]

Example filenames:[[BR]]

W_XX-EUMETSAT-sva,atms,DBNet+noaa20+sva_C_EUMS_20180319071907_atms_20180319_070840_j01_01716_ear_sva_sdr_bufr.bin [[BR]]

W_XX-EUMETSAT-mas,atms,DBNet+noaa20+mas_C_EUMS_20180319041205_atms_20180319_035712_j01_01714_ear_mas_sdr_bufr.bin [[BR]]

Please note that the NOAA-20 ATMS SDRs currently have provisional maturity status which is defined by NOAA as follows: [[BR]]

- Product performance has been demonstrated through analysis of a large, but still limited (i.e., not necessarily globally or seasonally representative) number of independent measurements obtained from selected locations, time periods, or field campaign efforts.[[BR]]

- Product analyses are sufficient for qualitative, and limited quantitative, determination of product fitness-for-purpose.[[BR]]

- Documentation of product performance, testing involving product fixes, identified product performance anomalies, including recommended remediation strategies, exists.[[BR]]

- Product is recommended for potential operational use (user decision) and in scientific publications after consulting product status documents.[[BR]]

Access to the data will be automatically provided for Member State NMSes and registered manufacturers. Following a successful trial, it is planned to make them available to the wider EUMETCast User community.[[BR]]

A trial dissemination of NOAA-20 EARS-CrIS and EARS-VIIRS data is planned to start on 16 April 2018.[[BR]]
