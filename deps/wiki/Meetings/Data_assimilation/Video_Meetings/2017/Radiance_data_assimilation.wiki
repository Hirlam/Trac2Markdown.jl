== Topics of meeting: ==

* ** Actions from Previous Meeting:** (see below or [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/UseObs201605 the WW page])

 - **Action-2**: MET is on track (more info below), MF (see below the update from Philippe).[[BR]]

 - **Action-3**: This is on keeping each other informed about any decision on studies with accounting the observation foot-print in DA. **Roger** informed the participants that they won the ALERTNESS project, where on of work package is dealing with DA and accounting of foot-print of observations is included in on of tasks. He also mentioned that they are asked to do some small budget cut in the project and the decision was not yet taken regarding the task(s) to be withdrawn from the project.[[BR]]

  - **Actions from WW on UoO:**
  - **Action-6 (from WW on UoO)**: we decided to have a follow up discussion meeting on the choice of field of views for ATMS radiances. [[BR]]
      ==> Kept.[[BR]]

  - **Action-8 (from WW on UoO)**: Done.[[BR]]


**Microwave instruments:**[[BR]]

**AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS radianes:**[[BR]]
  - ** Joan** reported the results of their investigation on the use of channel 10 from AMSU-A. The found relatively large first-guess departure (O-B) statistics. and the results impact study (???) was not good. They decided to not use this channel in their assimilation system. **Roger** mentioned that **Xiaohua Yang** showed him the distribution of the vertical model levels in the stratosphere. Around the peaking level of channel 10, there are roughly 5 model levels, which is not enough for good estimation of brightness temperature from the model. Philippe mentioned also that after lowering the AROME model top, they found also not suitable statistics of O-B for assimilation. We also discuced the use of global model to compensate the stratospheric model accuracy in AROME. [[BR]]

 **Action-1 on Philippe** to ask Vincent Guidard on the use of ARPEGE model above the AROME model top in radiance simulation.[[BR]]

  - **Philippe** reported that they finished the update of the emissivity atlases. Now they have monthly dataset instead on only one earlier.Now we have 3 choices for microwave radiance assimilation: [[BR]]
  1-- Use dynamical emissivity [[BR]]
  2-- Use of atlases [[BR]]
  3-- Use of default emissivity value [[BR]]

 In fact, through namelist settings, one can use both 1) and 2) depending on different situations.[[BR]]

 **Action-2 on Philippe** to provide the new atlases with short documentation on how to use them.[[BR]]

  - **Sigurdur and Roger** informed about the ATOVS implementation work at IMO. They finished the implementation in IGA domain (with Iceland and south part of Greenland in). Now they started the implementation on IGB (with Iceland and the full Greenland in). They finished the diagnostic run. Next step is to choose the good channels and blacklisting of the odd paths at different assimilation time.[[BR]]

  - **Roger** mentioned that he found at last TOVS conference that at ECMWF they don't use the channel 9 and at NCEP they don't use channels 8 and 9 from the NOAA-18. Mohamed Dahoui (ECMWF) and Andrew Collard (NCEP) didn't give clear explanation about the decision to Roger.[[BR]]
  - (added after the meeting by Roger) he followed the discussion by looking to the monitoring of this instrument in the AROME-Arctic model. He found, indeed, difference between the statistics for the channel 9 onboard different satellites (see these three plots for [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Data_assimilation/Video_Meetings/2017/Radiance_data_assimilation/NOAA_18_12.eps NOAA-18], [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Data_assimilation/Video_Meetings/2017/Radiance_data_assimilation/NOAA_19_12.eps NOAA-19] and [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Data_assimilation/Video_Meetings/2017/Radiance_data_assimilation/Metop_B_12.eps METOP-B]). So, Roger also suggest to put the channel 9 to passive assimilation. [[BR]]

**ATMS radiances:**
  - Both **Mats and Philippe** reported short problem related to the processing of the ATMS radiances in their centre. While at DMI the problem was related to the usual data fetching, at Meteo France the problem was related to the fact that processing sub-centre was changed in the BUFR file. The problems are fixed now in both centres.[[BR]]
  - **Philippe** asked Roger about the use of mask file he provided earlier. The purpose of this file is to define the averaging size of ATMS data in Bator. Roger forgot about it. [[BR]]

 **Action-3** on Roger to check how the use of mask file in HARMONIE-AROME DA.[[BR]]

  - **Roger & Sigurdur** started also the assimilation of ATMS radiances in IGB model.[[BR]]

 **Action-4 on Mats and Roger** to clarify how the superobbing of ATMS is done at DMI. [[BR]]

  - **Patrik** asked if the superobbing is model resolution dependent. It would be nice to have answer to this question at next video meeting.[[BR]]
  - **Roger** informed the NOAA-20 with 2nd ATMS and CrIS instruments onboard. It's time to add these instruments in our DA system.[[BR]]

**GPM GMI, SSMI-S, AMSUR2, All-sky radiances:**[[BR]]

  - **Philippe** mentioned that the use of the newly updated atlases improved the assimilation of GMI radiances, were the atlas option is in use in most of the cases.[[BR]]
  - **Philippe** mentioned that they found good results form testing of the AMSR2 data in ARPEGE. Meteo France started the monitoring of the MTVZA-GY instrument from Meteor-3M satellite.[[BR]]
  - To the question from Roger about the satellite FY-3C usage at Meteo France, Philippe said that they use data from MWHS2 instrument. [[BR]]

  - **Roger** said that the use of All-sky radiances is also defined in the ALERTNESS project. [[BR]]
  - **Philippe** mentioned that at Meteo France they start to see the impact of 1D+4DVAR assimilation of (so far) SAFIR data in ARPEGE. This method retrieves temperature and humidity on fly, which are assimilated as relative humidity or specific humidity or both temperature and specific humidity. **Philippe** said that one the best feature of the ECMWF solution is that they use a model that prescribes the observation error. This improves a lot the All-sky assimilation. **Philippe** said that this model can be also used in his scheme.[[BR]]
 
 


**Infrared instruments:**[[BR]]

**Seviri radiances:** [[BR]]
  - **Roger** promised Xiaohua to help with Seviri data assimilation in his nowcasting system. [[BR]]


**IASI radiances:**[[BR]]
  - ** Vincent** implemented new emissivity altases (also monthly) to IASI assimilation, which improve the assimilation of low peaking channels.[[BR]]

**AIRS, CrIS radiances:** No update so far, but Philippe needs to check this.[[BR]]



** VarBC:**[[BR]]
 **Roel and Roger** informed the Hirlam participants that many new branches, the 40h1.2, and the trunk have buggy Fetch_assim_data script. As consequence of the bug, the VarBC coefficients are not well updated. **Roger** will find solution for this problem. The easiest solution is to take the script from 40h1.1.

  - **Patrik** reported about the study on set up of VarBC coefficients for LAM with **Mate**.[[BR]]

**Annex: Mail from Patrik**[[BR]]
We examined initialization of VarBC in a limited-area model which is non-trivial task for observations from moving platforms like polar satellites. Various VarBC initialization techniques were tested (warmstart, coldstart, coldstart proposed by Magnus, using global bias parameters and offline Harris and Kelly) considering only the best scenario (at 9 UTC for MetOp-B) where there was realitvely good data coverage of the limited area and no other times when coverage was poor. We stated some general conclusions:[[BR]]
 - coldstart techinque requires excessive spin-up period in LAMs e.g. 3-4 months period for particular AMSU-A and IASI channels. Moreover, the 200-50 hPa thickness predictor was found to be highly correlated with the constant predictor.[[BR]]
 - coldstart technique proposed by Magnus (Lindskog, 2012) reduced the spin-up period for these particular AMSU-A channels up to 1-2 months,[[BR]]
 - global bias parameters are not fully representative in LAMs because of different model's complexity (spatial resolution, physics, RTTOV, ...). In ALADIN-CZ, the less representativity of global beta's was detected especially for low-peaking and stratospheric-peaking (AMSU-A and IASI). In addition, the global beta could change with the model-cycle i.e. adopting the global beta's to LAMs requires the strict model-cycle consistency.[[BR]]
 - the standard VarBC stiffnes parameter (NBG=5000) is not appropriate for LAMs. There are two reasons for this statement:[[BR]]
   1) high time-variation of beta's was detected especially for serially correlated moisture sensitive channels (MHS), [[BR]]
   2) in case of a sudden instrument change, the standard stiffness parameter is too large (for particular AMSUA-A/IASI channels) to adjust beta's fast enough, and the system may perform significantly worse.[[BR]]

Based on variance-bias trade-off concept, we proposed a new formulation of the stiffness parameter for LAMs. At the moment, this formulation was tested:[[BR]]
 1) during warmstart initialization spin-up period in ALADIN-CZ,[[BR]]
 2) in case of artificial instrument bias (monitoring the VarBC response).[[BR]]

The preliminary results seem promising. We also plan to:[[BR]]
 1) make a fair comparision of the initialization techniques in full data assimilation cycle (including the new NBG formulation)[[BR]]
 2) do additional experiments to verify that the new NBG formulation is optimum for LAM systems,[[BR]]
 3) verify the performance of the new NBG formulation in 3-hour data assimilation system with impact study.[[BR]]

== Topics of meeting: ==

** Actions from Previous Meeting:** (see below or [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/UseObs201605 the WW page])
 - **Action-1**: Done.
 - **Action-2**: MET is on track (more info below), MF (Philippe was absent -- no information).
 - **Action-3**: Kept.

      ==> Kept.


– **Microwave instruments:**
**AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS radianes:**[[BR]]
 - **Sigurdur** was not present at the beginning of the meeting. **Roger** reported about the progress with ATOVS implementation in Iceland with the following main messages:[[BR]]
 - The ATOVS implementation started almost at the same time at both IMO and AEMET. While AEMET could find within relatively shorter time an optimal setting for use of ATOVS, although very conservative (not using channels 5 and 10), at IMO no positive impact of ATOVS was found after about 10 different experiments. The experiments checked the efficiency of mainly channel 5 from both AMSU-A and AMSU-B/MHS and tuning of VarBC coefficients. [[BR]]
 - It turned out that in the verification against observation, only stations at cost lines were used in both Iceland and Greenland. When adding more inland stations over Iceland, the picture on impact of ATOVS radiances have changed. Although, the first results suggest that the forecasts over cost lines are not yet optimal, in general the ATOVS data have positive impact over the Icelandic model domain.[[BR]]
 - Still a clear large bias on surface pressure was observed. Additional blacklisting of local synop stations on T2m and geopotential was worked out. The result of this blacklisting is a clear positive impact on U10m (for all tested thresholds) and precipitation (especially for high precipitating events). At reduction of this minutes, the experiment in ongoing.[[BR]]

 - **Roger** reported about the importance of checking the mf_blacklist.b file before compiling the executable for any experiments. It should provide good blacklisting of bad channels. Note that this can be also controlled through use of the LIST-LOC files. In fact he observed clear negative impact of ATOVS in rapid refresh (RR) run, while in 3-hourly DA cycling no problem was detected. But, the difference between these two test is the chosen period. RUC was tested in 2015, and RR was tested in 2016. in meanwhile the channel 8 from Metop-A was degraded, providing clear problem in 2016. [[BR]]

 - **Joan and Maria** reported that they are testing channels 6 to 9 from AMSU-A with GNSS ZTD in their pre-operational system.[[BR]]

– **GPM GMI, SSMI-S, All-sky radiances:**[[BR]]
  - **Roger** said that they are waiting the CY43 to start the ECMWF solution for All-Sky radiance. [[BR]]
 


– **Infrared instruments:**[[BR]]
**Seviri radiances:** [[BR]]
 - **Magnus** reported that he is working on assimilation of Sevrir radiances in 4D-VAR. The work is progressing well. [[BR]]


– **IASI radiances:**[[BR]]
 - ** Roger** reported that he checked the impact of IASI radiances in rapid refresh system and found positive impact.[[BR]]



– ** VarBC:**[[BR]]
 - **Patrik** reported about the study on set up of VarBC coefficients for LAM with **Mate**. They studied the efficiency of VarBC coefficients estimated in different ways: 1) starting with cold start and zero coefficients; 2) starting with global coefficients and warm start; and 3) using Harris and Kelly scheme.[[BR]]
 - Using cold start 1), they found suspicious values and influence for low peaking (5-7) channels. Also, they need 3 to 4 months to stabilise the coefficients in this case. In this case the scan angle biases are not good enough.[[BR]]
 - Using global coefficients and warm start  2), it needs 1 to 2 weeks to have stable coefficients. In this case scan angle biases are good.[[BR]]
 - Using Harris and Kelly 3), 30 days can provide good parameters. This means that the quality of the bias parameters is similar for the low peaking channels.[[BR]]
 - Their study was limited to the computation of bias coefficients. **Patrik** was encouraged to extend this work to impact study.[[BR]]
 
 - **Roger** mentioned that he published his work on Harris & Kelly, which a copy can be found [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/Idojaras_bias_corr.pdf in Randriamampianina, 2005]

 - **Roger** asked what are the criteria used in this study and what is the main reason of the differences? **Patrik** said that the bias coefficients depend on few things: the number of available observations; the used predictors; the used scheme; the famous NBG, which is the default (5000) in their study; …[[BR]]
 - **Magnus** asked based on 2) above, can one use a coefficients estimated for a neighbouring model domain to start the estimation of new coefficients using warm start? An extended answer to this question can be found in the annex below, when Patrik and Magnus continued the discussion after the meeting.[[BR]]

 - **Patrik** asked **Roger** about his theory based on aggregating the bias coefficients daily. The question was about to neighbouring assimilation times, where one of them covered with good satellite path, while the other one occupied just with a small portion of path. In such a cases, for the small portion of path, if after one month of spin up, the bias is not converging the nominal, **Roger** suggest to blacklist the instrument with small portion. Based on the new finding of **Patrik and Mate**, one can use the coefficients estimated with full path to warm start the coefficients for the small path. Although, we don’t know yet the impact of the warm-start-estimated coefficients, in this case a “iterative” computation of coefficients would help, in the second iteration, the coefficients from the full path can be used to warm-start that of the small path (this is added by Roger after the meeting).[[BR]]
 - **Roger** asked **Patrik** about his idea on using NBG depending on the number active observations at each assimilation time. **Patrik** said that he doesn’t have a final idea about it. It’s well known that large NBG would slow the adaptivity of the scheme, and small NBG would speed. **Patrik** said that for humidity sensitive microwave radiances, slow adaptivity may be better, than a fast one.[[BR]]

– ** Annex:** E-mail from **Patrik** to Magnus after the meeting:[[BR]]
"thanks for the extensive mail. I try to clarify my statements. I put Roger to cc to have possibility to react.[[BR]]

 -**Firstly**, I claim that it is better to initialize the regional VarBC scheme using warmstart rather than coldstart method for the default VarBC setting (nbg=5000). The warmstart method is more beneficial with regards to:
  * the spin-up period (compare [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/FigB.png Fig.B] and [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/FigC.png Fig.C]),
  * no collinearity between predictors
  * better estimation of scan-line and air-mass bias parameters. After one-month spin-up period, we detected better bias correction in terms of O-B departures (BIAS and STD) for the low-peaking AMSU-A channels 5 to 7 using the warmstart method (see Fig.A). The slight degradation of STD of O-B departures using the coldstart method is probably due to underestimated scan-line bias parameters p8-10 ([https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/FigB.png see Fig.B]). The higher adaptivity (as you described in your study) would be beneficial for the coldstart in terms of the correction of BIAS value, however, I wonder about the influence of model biases on the scan-line and air-mass bias parameters (not tested yet).

 -**Secondly**, direct use of global bias parameters in regional VarBC scheme (e.g. MF for polar satellites) is restricted by the following assumptions:
   * radiance bias estimate is similar (spatial resolution, model cycle including forward model, physics, parametrisation asw. ),
   * the same set of predictors,
   * the same satellite data pre-processing.
 - These assumptions are not fulfil for most of regional models, however, I claim that it is beneficial to use the global bias parameters (e.g. Arpege) not directly, but as initial in warmstart and than adapt the bias parameters to the regional model conditions during spin-up period. I think it is possible to initialize your regional VarBC scheme by pre-existing bias parameters from other regional models, however, again it is necessary to use the warmstart method to adapt the bias parameters to your regional model conditions (different at least in terms of model biases).

 -**Finally**, there is questionable how set the adaptivity of bias parameters in the regional VarBC scheme. [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/FigD.png Fig.D] presents the time-evolution of bias parameters for a particular MHS channel during the warmstart spin-up period (similar for active data assimilation, but the fluctuation with less extend). High adaptivity is risky in terms of the air-mass and scan-line bias parameter estimate, because too adaptive scheme is able to remove the spatial systematic departures (polynomial scan-line predictors) that are actually related for MHS to humidity errors in the NWP model.

 - At the moment, I'm preparing a paper about an optimal VarBC initialization approach for regional model. How set the adaptivity in passive and active data assimilation is still under investigation. The VarBC adaptivity is in regional model a trade-off between the response to instrument bias changes and the NWP model biases. At the moment, I think that the bias parameter error setting should be dependent on the observation sample, however, this is still a preliminary result."

** Actions from Previous Meeting:** (see below or [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/UseObs201605 the WW page])
- **Action-1**: Done.
- **Action-2**: MET is on track (more info below), MF (Philippe was absent -- no information).
- **Action-3**: Kept.
- **Actions from WW on UoO:**
- **Action-6**: Kept
- **Action-8**: Kept.


– **Microwave instruments:**
**AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS radianes:**
- **Sigurdur** reported the result of passive assimilation of ATOVS on their smaller domain.
- The participants expressed the need of separate meeting on the use of ATOVS radiances.
- **AEMET** performed impact study after one month passive assimilation. The active assimilation show positive impact of ATOVS on relative humidity.
- There was question of blacklisting of channel 3 from NOAA-19 MHS. It is better to be blacklisted. 

– **GPM GMI, SSMI-S, All-sky radiances:**
 - **MET** will check the availability of SSMI/S in its local network.
 - **MET** started the implementation of All-Sky radiances in CY40. They quickly understood that this cycle is not the best one to start this task. They succeed to understand most of the tasks to be done with the implementation process. They are waiting for the CY43 to do this task.

– **Infrared instruments:**
**Seviri radiances:** 
- **Vincent** reported that when changing the two parameters to reduce the thinning distance in AROME system, they got negative impact of Seviri data. It seems that the two parameters (RFIND_*, RMIND*) are not well taken into account during the screening. The tested with RFIND_SEVIRI=70000; RMIND_SEVIRI=35000. Their is need to get in touch with ECMWF with this issue.

– **IASI radiances:**
- The implementation of IASI radiances (through EUMETCAST) at IMO will be discussed during the meeting in October in Reykjavik (Arctic study project between MET and IMO).
- We discussed the availability of emissivity data in the system for assimilation of IASI in cloudy condition. **Vincent** mentioned that they have worked on this task and can provide examples based on CY41/CY42. Tuuli has plan to work on this.


– ** VarBC:**
- **Roger ** asked **Vincent** about testing in AROME model the use of global coefficients versus LAM ones. **Vincent** is willing to do this exercise. He will come back with more concrete date for the testing.

== Topics of meeting: ==
– **Microwave instruments:**
**AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS radianes:**
 Spain reported that they have 3 weeks of passive assimilation of AMSU-A/AMSU-B/MHS using
 MARS data. They doubt about the thinning of MHS radiances from Metop-B satellite. They found
 too many data kept in the assimilation.

**Actions-1:** To Roger to check the suspicious results from AEMET radiances monitoring and identify the source of problem.

– **GPM GMI, SSMI-S, All-sky radiances:**
 **Meteo France** reported that they are monitoring new imager instruments such as GPM GMI and F19- SSMI-S. They have 6 months runs for this purpose. From February 1rst F19 data are not disseminated in real-time.(Here I'm not sure I understood well: SSMI-S have separate VarBC predictors for ascending and descending orbits). F18 and F17 are available in CY40. 
 They also monitor from Chinese FY-3C MWHS-2 (humidity sensitive instrument). They are interested first with humidity sensitive channels. Regarding all-sky radiance assimilation Meteo France is implementing Bayesian technique similar to what was implemented for assimilation of radar reflectivity. It was mentioned that the observation error for all-sky radiances can reach 100 K, which makes these data difficult to handle. 

**Action-2:** inter-comparison of all-sky assimilation solutions: MET Norway (contact person: Roohollah) will test the ECMWF solution, and Meteo France (contact person: Phillipe) will use Bayesian technique for all-sky assimilation, and we will see if more systematic comparison can be worked out.

– **Infrared instruments:**
**Seviri radiances:** 
 **Magnus** reported that he implemented the Seviri radiances in frame of DNICAST project. He used the LACE technique for pre-processing of Seviri radiances. He is using so far two water vapour channels and use only the off-set part in VarBC. He found very promising results. Patrik commented that the predictors 1, 2, and 4 have indeed low influence in the bias correction for Seviri radiances.
 Meteo France is using more channels from Seviri and observe positive impact on 2m temperature and humidity.

– **IASI radiances:**
 We found out that we (from Hirlam so far MetCoOp have implemented these in operational) found that Meteo France can use more low tropospheric and surface sensitive channels because they do in-line retrieval of surface emissivity (???). It was also mentioned that one can activate the use of the emissivity database in the RTTOV11 to handle properly different surface in the model domain (if possible/needed please elaborate...).

– ** VarBC:**
 The participants agreed that for limited area model with well defined NBG parameters (defining the speed of adaptivity of the scheme), 14 days should be enough to estimate good coefficients.
 There was discussion of some results from UK Met Office and also Patrik about the dependency of the NBG parameters with the number of active radiance observations.

– **Accounting of footprint in radiance assimilation:**
 **Vincent** mentioned some study done at Meteo France some time ago accounting more grid points in the model space as first-guess information. This study was done in context of clear sky radiance assimilation, which gave neutral impact. We agreed that taking account the ellipsoid have some consequences not only in RT but also in TL and AD models, which should be handled properly.

**Action-3:** Keep each other informed about any project related to use of footprint information in radiance assimilation.
