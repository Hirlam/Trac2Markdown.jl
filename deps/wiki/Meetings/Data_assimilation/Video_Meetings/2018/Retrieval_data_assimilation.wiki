**AMV – atmospheric motion vectors: **[[BR]]
 * Erik has a plan to test the locally produced HRW in !MetCoOp jourly suit nowcasting system.[[BR]]

**ASCAT data **[[BR]]
 * Not discussed.[[BR]]

**GPS ZTD: **[[BR]]
 * **Maria** couldn't make it but she sent an e-mail informing us about her progress with GPS ZTD implementation:"I would like to tell you about the progress of GNSS over Canary Island. Using Jana approach of updating VARBC coefficients at 00 and 12 UTC, the calibration of the coefficients is stable now. So this part it's nice, after one month of the experiment the impact are not clear, at 12 UTC humidity scores improve, it's more clear near 700hPa, at 00 UTC humidity scores decrease over 400 hPa and surface. Now I am going to check the results for a case study on a rainfall event."
 * **Jana** said that they use the off-set only in the VarBC for GPS ZTD. MF is willing to test some predictors.


**GPS Gradients in ZTD**: [[BR]]
 - Not discussed, but will be activated at MF ASAP , maybe with Morocco. [[BR]]

**GPS STD: **[[BR]]
 * **Siebren** promised to give update by May.[[BR]]

**GPS RO**: [[BR]]
 * MF plan for the next e-suite to add data from FY-3C.[[BR]]

**Action on Claude** to ask any information regarding the use of GPS-RO as anchoring observation in DA.[[BR]]

**ADM Aeolus: (as lidar observation)**[[BR]]
 * **Roohollah** presented the first results of assimilation of a synthetic HLOS data in Harmonie using CY43h2T2. [[BR]] 

**Cloud initialisation:**
 * **Erik** reported about the plan to include this technique in the nowcasting suite for !MetCoOp, where for cloud base the SMHI solution will be used. This means that cloud base is the meteorological estimate of the cloud base from the SAF/NWC products.

== Topics of the day: ==

**AMV – atmospheric motion vectors: **[[BR]]
 * **Roger** informed the attendees that he found positive impact of the AMV data on rapid refresh scheme using the MetCoOp model. **Erik** will assimilate the AMV data in MetCoOp with earlier observations (with the ones taken from Vilje HPC and provided by Roger) in 38h1.2. He plans to move to cycle 40 later. **Erik** said that he would like to get in touch with all colleagues working with AMV. **Roger** mentioned that he will update the trunk and the howTo wiki with polar wind assimilation.[[BR]]

 * **Sigurdur** talked about the problem of monitoring of AMV data in passive way. Controlling this process through mf_blacklist.b puts the AMV data in blacklist also.[[BR]]

**ASCAT data **[[BR]]
 * **Siebren** said that, at KNMI, the next operational suit will use the ASCAT data. They are also testing the ASCAT data in 4DVar with cycle 40.[[BR]]
 * **Florian** mentioned they are using the ASCAT data, but he haven't checked yet the impact of these data.[[BR]]
 * **Isabel** found neutral to positive impact of the ASCAT data over ocean, when testing them, using CY40, over the Spanish Iberian domain.[[BR]]

**GPS ZTD: **[[BR]]
 * In continuation of the problem related to the bias correction of GPS-ZTD (the convergence of the bias at the assimilation times without radiosondes data was not so good), **Jana** tried to update the GPS-ZTD coefficients only twice a day and only when radiosonde data are available (00 and 12 UTC). By moving to this way of updating the VarBC, she could find better impact on precipitation. Also, better impact was found when more radiances data are available in the DA. She also found a diurnal cycle of the bias. **Roger** said that Mate Mile informed him that in Hungary they use only the off-set part of VraBC to correct bias of GPS-ZTD.

**GPS Gradients in ZTD**: [[BR]]
 - Not discussed. [[BR]]

**GPS STD: **[[BR]]
 * **Siebren** said that they are porting the necessary code to CY40 and test the assimilation of the GPS-STD in 4DVar. **Roger** asked: when the additional code be seen in the trunk? **Siebren** said that the code is not yet ready to be shared. Too many comments in the codes. He promised to make the code ready for testing to other in May 2018. [[BR]]
 * **Jana** was keen test "the not fully ready code" with 3DVar. It was said that the code will be also ready to be tested with 3DVar in CY40. **Eoin** will be happy to put into the DA branch "the not fully ready code" for testing.[[BR]]

**GPS RO**: [[BR]]
 * **Mats**, who didn't attend the meeting but asked by Roger, reported that he is running experiments to check the impact of GPS RO on VarBC. The DFS estimates show very good impact of GPS RO data on the analysis.
 * The observation value (refractivity vs bending angle) was also discussed. Experts (like for ex. Sean Healy) will be contacted regarding this question. Today, the bending angle is used at DMI, but probably the use of refrectivity can be more advantageous for low top model like the HARMONIE-Arome.

**ADM Aeolus: **
 * **Roger** informed the participants about the project started at MET Norway, which deals with the CAL/VAL of the simulated observations. **Roohollah and Roger** are in touch with Meteo France colleagues (Vivien Pourret and Frank Guillaume) regarding the needed update for handling of the ADM Aeolus data in our models. Vivien made the necessary update to CY43, but these modifications are not seen in the code we have got from Meteo France. **Eoin** said that he will be happy to help to put the data into ODB from BUFR.  

**Cloud initialisation:**
 * **Erik** added two more experiments (to the four already done). The cloud initialisation is done after the analysis and the experiments were done with CY38. **Erik and Magnus** are providing the code to CY40. **Erik** showed improvement in radiation and cloud forecast when using the additional initialisation scheme. But, in the upper-air, slightly worse score in observed at lower troposphere. Probably, this is the consequence of low quality of the definition of the cloud base. Until now, Erik tested two kinds of cloud base products: 1) interpolated synop observations; and 2) first guess-based information. The two products have pros and cons. Probably more cons. At SMHI, they are looking for product from the MESAN (combining 1) and 2) ).
 * **Siebren** added that they implemented this technique in HIRLAM model with 11 km resolution, where the representation of cloud base by SYNOP observation was good enough, while this is not true for high resolution model like the HARMONIE-Arome.
 * **Mihal** said that it is worth to distinguish manual SYNOP from automatic ones. They have slightly different quality.
 * **Carlos** said that in EUMETSAT cloud mask data there should be information about cloud base estimate. This is worth to check in the real-time data from EUMETSAT. 
 * **Carlos** continued his explanation with the following mail: "Regarding the cloud-base products. What i wanted to say is that, at the CM-SAF (ClimateSAF, leading institue DWD), they have a product for Downward Longwave Irradiance at surface level, and that in order to produce this kind of product cloud-base estimates are necessary. In fact, in 2002-2003, when i collaborated with CM-SAF, i worked on this Longwave Irradiance retrievals. Another thing is that they also offer cloud-base product as such. It can be that only the Irradiance is in the catalogue. But if they were asked, maybe they could provide this parameter along with the rest of cloud products. At that time, the OSI-SAF (MeteoFrance) had also another way of estimating this cloud-base parameter, based on observed cloud-type and cloud-albedo. By means of RT simulations they obtained regressions that seemed to work well. One of the tasks was to compare both ways, OSI-SAF and CM-SAF, which at that time was a more crude approach, based on climatology."

== Topics of the day: ==

**AMV – atmospheric motion vectors: **[[BR]]
 -**Roger** Informed that they have written a final report about their study with EUMETSAT produced, locally produced and polar satellite based AMV data. They made study with both 3-hourly cycling and rapid refresh assimilation systems. The report will be available in this minutes. [[BR]]

**Action 1:** **Roger** to set up ftp server for real-time distribution of the locally produced high resolution winds. [[BR]]
 
 - **Mats** mentioned that at DMI they are able to use only few observations with close to neutral impact. [[BR]]
 - **!MetCoOp** have plan to test the AMV data.
 
 
**ASCAT:** [[BR]]
 - **KNMI** have plan to use the ASCAT data in their next operational system. **Siebren** mentioned that they have new project, which aims at studying the impact of different observations, including ASCAT, in 4D-VAR. [[BR]]
 - **Roger** informed that **Teresa** is working on the assimilation of ASCAT data in a coupled atmosphere-wave system. Due to problem related to the setup of the coupled system this study is delayed. [[BR]]
 - **Isabel** asked about the results of ASCAT data at MET Norway. **Roger** mentioned that the ASCAT data are assimilated operationally in both AROME-!MetCoOp and AROME-Arctic. Isabel informed that she is doing experiments with conventional, ASCAT and OSCAT surface winds using the Harmonie system and on the ECMWF platform. [[BR]]
 

**GPS ZTD: **[[BR]]
 - **Magnus** informed that with **Martin** and **Sigurdur**, they studied the impact of the updated GNAA observations. They tested the following settings: 1) use of one versus more predictors; 2) different thinning distances; and 3) use of improved background errors. While 1) provides moderate positive impact, 2) provide positive, but they observed problem related to remaining bias at lower model levels. 3) gives positive impact. [[BR]]
 - **Siebren** mentioned that they have plan to compare the impact of GPS ZTD against GPS slant delay in the near future. [[BR]]
 
 - **Jana** informed that at AEMET they use 50 km thinning distance in the pre-operational run with the ATOVS radiances. As next task, they would like to tune the observation errors of the ZTD observations. [[BR]]

**GPS Gradients in ZTD**: [[BR]]
 - Not discussed. [[BR]]

**GPS STD: **[[BR]]
- **Siebren** [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Retrieval_data_assimilation/FWS-WG2-SdH.pptx presented] the updated observation operator for STD. He made a 10 days observation usage monitoring. He found out that his setup uses 5% of STD observations. The statistics of O-B and O-A look good. Verification of a short period run against observations shows positive impact up 9 – 12 hour forecasts. Impact on humidity is negative on bias. [[BR]]
 - ** Siebren** showed case studies comparing 2,5 km, 1 km models with radar observations. He showed that STD have clear local effect/impact. He also mentioned that signature on precipitation forecasts is well seen throughout series of forecasts. He plans to do longer test with STD observations from Germany and Belgium using June 2016. 
 - Next plan is to insert the STD data into E-GVAP real-time system. [[BR]]

** GPS RO**: [[BR]]
 - **Mats** informed that DMI is running OSEs now also with GPS RO. Running hindcast experiments allow access to more observation compared to real-time access. They expect a indirect impact of GPS RO also on radiances assimilation. [[BR]]
 - **Magnus** answered to question from Roger that in !MetCoOp Mode-S data have higher priority than GPS RO. [[BR]]
