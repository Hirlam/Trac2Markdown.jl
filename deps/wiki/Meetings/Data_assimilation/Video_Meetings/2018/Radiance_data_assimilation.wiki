== Topics of meeting: ==

* ** Actions from Previous Meeting:** (see below or [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/UseObs201605 the WW page])

 

 - **Action-1**: MF found bug in VarBC in the way it's applied in AROME. 2 microwave sensors (GMI & MWS-2 FY-3c used the predictor using 5- 10 hPa data. They will correct it. In Harmonie we don't use this predictor.[[BR]]
  - Regarding the use of ARPEGE model above the AROME model top, the modification is not yet done. It will be done before IRS from MTG. It's more important for IRS, since the simulation of certain channels is not possible otherwise. Some channels are sensitive in stratosphere and troposphere.[[BR]]

 - **Action-2**: MET is on track (more info below), MF (see below the update from Philippe).[[BR]]

**Microwave instruments:**[[BR]]

 **AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS radianes:**[[BR]]
  - **MWH-2** - From first of April up to now, EUMETSAT reported about geoplocation issue. It has impact in the operational system at MF. Data are now blacklisted.[[BR]]
  - **ATMS** - The is now new ATMS on board NOAA-20. Trial data dissemination are available in April.[[BR]]
  - **MWR/I** - MF started to receive these data.[[BR]]
  - **AMSR** - MF keeps working on this instrument.[[BR]]
  - **Joan** reported that he observed a decrease of number of available data in the morning assimilation times. New blacklist and VarBC are needs to be prepared.[[BR]]
  - Maneuver of NOAA-18 by NOAA-20. Keep reading the new! (see the posted mail in the Annex).[[BR]]
  - **Roger** observed strange changes in bias for channel 9. Maybe it it's due to the diurnal bias in the AROME-Arctic model.[[BR]]
  - **Jana** was interested in Patrik's method for VarBC computation. **Alena** promised to ask Patrik to answer the e-mail.[[BR]]
  - **Sigurdur** showed the results from testing the dynamical emissivity and Atlases in Harmonie. **Philippe** said that in hretr.F90 there is control about where to use the dynamical or Atlases solutions [https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/tags/harmonie-40h1.1.rc.1/src/arpifs/op_obs/hretr.F90 see the code]. He asked statistics about the use of the different solutions in our implementation. For that he is interested in the statics of emis_fg, emos_retr and emis_atlas. He mentioned that Florian showed [http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/itwg/itsc/itsc21/program/posters/7p.05_suzat.pdf such stats at the last TOVS conference].[[BR]]

  - **Action-1 to Philippe** to look at the possibility of splitting the VarBC over land & sea.[[BR]]

 **ATMS radiances:**[[BR]]

  - **ATMS** - The is now new ATMS on board NOAA-20. Trial data dissemination are available in April.[[BR]]

  - **Action-2 on Philippe** to report about the impact of ATMS radiances in the ARMOE-Fr model.[[BR]]

  - **Action-3** on Roger to check how the use of mask file in HARMONIE-AROME DA.[[BR]]

  - **Action-4 on Mats and Roger** to clarify how the superobbing of ATMS is done at DMI. [[BR]]

 **All sky radiances at MF:**
 - **Philippe** reported that the implementation of the Bayesian retrieval technique for All-sky Megha-Tropiques data in ARPEGE is ongoing and he needs to finalize the dedicated thinning. Separate thinning distances is applied for clear sky and cloudy area DA. This was tested by GMAO and resulted better impact. ECMWF uses superobbing for All-sky up to the resolution of 3rd outr-loop.
 - **Philippe** mentioned that the implementation of ECMWF version of All-sky assimilation will need to figure out the use of ECMWF physics.

 **MTVZA-GY radiances:** it's as SSMI/S like instrument, but the activity failed (???).

**Infrared instruments:**[[BR]]

**Seviri radiances:** [[BR]]
 - ** CrIS radiances:** New data from NOAA-20 will be available soon.[[BR]]
 - ** IASI radiances:** **Vincent** have good impact of accounting the inter-correlation error between channels. This was done using the same number of active channels. This will likely to be in the next MF parallel suite.[[BR]]


**Annex: Mail received by Philipp from EUMETSAT**[[BR]]
Dear Members of the STG-OPS Working Group,[[BR]]
We plan to start a trial dissemination of NOAA-20 EARS-ATMS Sensor Data Records (SDRs) on 3 April 2018.[[BR]]
The product format is the same as the operational S-NPP EARS-ATMS products and the filenames follow the same pattern – see: https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Data/RegionalDataServiceEARS/EARSATMS/index.html.[[BR]]
The products are currently generated at the Athens, Kangerlussuaq, Lannion, Maspalomas and Svalbard stations.[[BR]]
They will be distributed on EUMETCast Europe, on channel NPP-2 (PID: 500, Multicast address: 224.223.222.2).[[BR]]

Example filenames:[[BR]]

W_XX-EUMETSAT-sva,atms,DBNet+noaa20+sva_C_EUMS_20180319071907_atms_20180319_070840_j01_01716_ear_sva_sdr_bufr.bin [[BR]]

W_XX-EUMETSAT-mas,atms,DBNet+noaa20+mas_C_EUMS_20180319041205_atms_20180319_035712_j01_01714_ear_mas_sdr_bufr.bin [[BR]]

Please note that the NOAA-20 ATMS SDRs currently have provisional maturity status which is defined by NOAA as follows: [[BR]]

- Product performance has been demonstrated through analysis of a large, but still limited (i.e., not necessarily globally or seasonally representative) number of independent measurements obtained from selected locations, time periods, or field campaign efforts.[[BR]]

- Product analyses are sufficient for qualitative, and limited quantitative, determination of product fitness-for-purpose.[[BR]]

- Documentation of product performance, testing involving product fixes, identified product performance anomalies, including recommended remediation strategies, exists.[[BR]]

- Product is recommended for potential operational use (user decision) and in scientific publications after consulting product status documents.[[BR]]

Access to the data will be automatically provided for Member State NMSes and registered manufacturers. Following a successful trial, it is planned to make them available to the wider EUMETCast User community.[[BR]]

A trial dissemination of NOAA-20 EARS-CrIS and EARS-VIIRS data is planned to start on 16 April 2018.[[BR]]

== Topics of meeting: ==

* ** Actions from Previous Meeting:** (see below or [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/UseObs201605 the WW page])

 - **Action-2**: MET is on track (more info below), MF (see below the update from Philippe).[[BR]]

 - **Action-3**: This is on keeping each other informed about any decision on studies with accounting the observation foot-print in DA. **Roger** informed the participants that they won the ALERTNESS project, where on of work package is dealing with DA and accounting of foot-print of observations is included in on of tasks. He also mentioned that they are asked to do some small budget cut in the project and the decision was not yet taken regarding the task(s) to be withdrawn from the project.[[BR]]

  - **Actions from WW on UoO:**
  - **Action-6 (from WW on UoO)**: we decided to have a follow up discussion meeting on the choice of field of views for ATMS radiances. [[BR]]
      ==> Kept.[[BR]]

  - **Action-8 (from WW on UoO)**: Done.[[BR]]


**Microwave instruments:**[[BR]]

**AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS radianes:**[[BR]]
  - ** Joan** reported the results of their investigation on the use of channel 10 from AMSU-A. The found relatively large first-guess departure (O-B) statistics. and the results impact study (???) was not good. They decided to not use this channel in their assimilation system. **Roger** mentioned that **Xiaohua Yang** showed him the distribution of the vertical model levels in the stratosphere. Around the peaking level of channel 10, there are roughly 5 model levels, which is not enough for good estimation of brightness temperature from the model. Philippe mentioned also that after lowering the AROME model top, they found also not suitable statistics of O-B for assimilation. We also discuced the use of global model to compensate the stratospheric model accuracy in AROME. [[BR]]

 **Action-1 on Philippe** to ask Vincent Guidard on the use of ARPEGE model above the AROME model top in radiance simulation.[[BR]]

  - **Philippe** reported that they finished the update of the emissivity atlases. Now they have monthly dataset instead on only one earlier.Now we have 3 choices for microwave radiance assimilation: [[BR]]
  1-- Use dynamical emissivity [[BR]]
  2-- Use of atlases [[BR]]
  3-- Use of default emissivity value [[BR]]

 In fact, through namelist settings, one can use both 1) and 2) depending on different situations.[[BR]]

 **Action-2 on Philippe** to provide the new atlases with short documentation on how to use them.[[BR]]

  - **Sigurdur and Roger** informed about the ATOVS implementation work at IMO. They finished the implementation in IGA domain (with Iceland and south part of Greenland in). Now they started the implementation on IGB (with Iceland and the full Greenland in). They finished the diagnostic run. Next step is to choose the good channels and blacklisting of the odd paths at different assimilation time.[[BR]]

  - **Roger** mentioned that he found at last TOVS conference that at ECMWF they don't use the channel 9 and at NCEP they don't use channels 8 and 9 from the NOAA-18. Mohamed Dahoui (ECMWF) and Andrew Collard (NCEP) didn't give clear explanation about the decision to Roger.[[BR]]
  - (added after the meeting by Roger) he followed the discussion by looking to the monitoring of this instrument in the AROME-Arctic model. He found, indeed, difference between the statistics for the channel 9 onboard different satellites (see these three plots for [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Data_assimilation/Video_Meetings/2017/Radiance_data_assimilation/NOAA_18_12.eps NOAA-18], [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Data_assimilation/Video_Meetings/2017/Radiance_data_assimilation/NOAA_19_12.eps NOAA-19] and [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Data_assimilation/Video_Meetings/2017/Radiance_data_assimilation/Metop_B_12.eps METOP-B]). So, Roger also suggest to put the channel 9 to passive assimilation. [[BR]]

**ATMS radiances:**
  - Both **Mats and Philippe** reported short problem related to the processing of the ATMS radiances in their centre. While at DMI the problem was related to the usual data fetching, at Meteo France the problem was related to the fact that processing sub-centre was changed in the BUFR file. The problems are fixed now in both centres.[[BR]]
  - **Philippe** asked Roger about the use of mask file he provided earlier. The purpose of this file is to define the averaging size of ATMS data in Bator. Roger forgot about it. [[BR]]

 **Action-3** on Roger to check how the use of mask file in HARMONIE-AROME DA.[[BR]]

  - **Roger & Sigurdur** started also the assimilation of ATMS radiances in IGB model.[[BR]]

 **Action-4 on Mats and Roger** to clarify how the superobbing of ATMS is done at DMI. [[BR]]

  - **Patrik** asked if the superobbing is model resolution dependent. It would be nice to have answer to this question at next video meeting.[[BR]]
  - **Roger** informed the NOAA-20 with 2nd ATMS and CrIS instruments onboard. It's time to add these instruments in our DA system.[[BR]]

**GPM GMI, SSMI-S, AMSUR2, All-sky radiances:**[[BR]]

  - **Philippe** mentioned that the use of the newly updated atlases improved the assimilation of GMI radiances, were the atlas option is in use in most of the cases.[[BR]]
  - **Philippe** mentioned that they found good results form testing of the AMSR2 data in ARPEGE. Meteo France started the monitoring of the MTVZA-GY instrument from Meteor-3M satellite.[[BR]]
  - To the question from Roger about the satellite FY-3C usage at Meteo France, Philippe said that they use data from MWHS2 instrument. [[BR]]

  - **Roger** said that the use of All-sky radiances is also defined in the ALERTNESS project. [[BR]]
  - **Philippe** mentioned that at Meteo France they start to see the impact of 1D+4DVAR assimilation of (so far) SAFIR data in ARPEGE. This method retrieves temperature and humidity on fly, which are assimilated as relative humidity or specific humidity or both temperature and specific humidity. **Philippe** said that one the best feature of the ECMWF solution is that they use a model that prescribes the observation error. This improves a lot the All-sky assimilation. **Philippe** said that this model can be also used in his scheme.[[BR]]
 
 


**Infrared instruments:**[[BR]]

**Seviri radiances:** [[BR]]
  - **Roger** promised Xiaohua to help with Seviri data assimilation in his nowcasting system. [[BR]]


**IASI radiances:**[[BR]]
  - ** Vincent** implemented new emissivity altases (also monthly) to IASI assimilation, which improve the assimilation of low peaking channels.[[BR]]

**AIRS, CrIS radiances:** No update so far, but Philippe needs to check this.[[BR]]



** VarBC:**[[BR]]
 **Roel and Roger** informed the Hirlam participants that many new branches, the 40h1.2, and the trunk have buggy Fetch_assim_data script. As consequence of the bug, the VarBC coefficients are not well updated. **Roger** will find solution for this problem. The easiest solution is to take the script from 40h1.1.

  - **Patrik** reported about the study on set up of VarBC coefficients for LAM with **Mate**.[[BR]]

**Annex: Mail from Patrik**[[BR]]
We examined initialization of VarBC in a limited-area model which is non-trivial task for observations from moving platforms like polar satellites. Various VarBC initialization techniques were tested (warmstart, coldstart, coldstart proposed by Magnus, using global bias parameters and offline Harris and Kelly) considering only the best scenario (at 9 UTC for MetOp-B) where there was realitvely good data coverage of the limited area and no other times when coverage was poor. We stated some general conclusions:[[BR]]
 - coldstart techinque requires excessive spin-up period in LAMs e.g. 3-4 months period for particular AMSU-A and IASI channels. Moreover, the 200-50 hPa thickness predictor was found to be highly correlated with the constant predictor.[[BR]]
 - coldstart technique proposed by Magnus (Lindskog, 2012) reduced the spin-up period for these particular AMSU-A channels up to 1-2 months,[[BR]]
 - global bias parameters are not fully representative in LAMs because of different model's complexity (spatial resolution, physics, RTTOV, ...). In ALADIN-CZ, the less representativity of global beta's was detected especially for low-peaking and stratospheric-peaking (AMSU-A and IASI). In addition, the global beta could change with the model-cycle i.e. adopting the global beta's to LAMs requires the strict model-cycle consistency.[[BR]]
 - the standard VarBC stiffnes parameter (NBG=5000) is not appropriate for LAMs. There are two reasons for this statement:[[BR]]
   1) high time-variation of beta's was detected especially for serially correlated moisture sensitive channels (MHS), [[BR]]
   2) in case of a sudden instrument change, the standard stiffness parameter is too large (for particular AMSUA-A/IASI channels) to adjust beta's fast enough, and the system may perform significantly worse.[[BR]]

Based on variance-bias trade-off concept, we proposed a new formulation of the stiffness parameter for LAMs. At the moment, this formulation was tested:[[BR]]
 1) during warmstart initialization spin-up period in ALADIN-CZ,[[BR]]
 2) in case of artificial instrument bias (monitoring the VarBC response).[[BR]]

The preliminary results seem promising. We also plan to:[[BR]]
 1) make a fair comparision of the initialization techniques in full data assimilation cycle (including the new NBG formulation)[[BR]]
 2) do additional experiments to verify that the new NBG formulation is optimum for LAM systems,[[BR]]
 3) verify the performance of the new NBG formulation in 3-hour data assimilation system with impact study.[[BR]]

** Actions from Previous Meeting:** (see below or [https://hirlam.org/trac/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/UseObs201605 the WW page])
 - **Action-1**: Done.
 - **Action-2**: MET is on track (more info below), MF (Philippe was absent -- no information).
 - **Action-3**: Kept.

      ==> Kept.


– **Microwave instruments:**
**AMSU-A, AMSU-B/MHS radianes:**[[BR]]
 - **Sigurdur** was not present at the beginning of the meeting. **Roger** reported about the progress with ATOVS implementation in Iceland with the following main messages:[[BR]]
 - The ATOVS implementation started almost at the same time at both IMO and AEMET. While AEMET could find within relatively shorter time an optimal setting for use of ATOVS, although very conservative (not using channels 5 and 10), at IMO no positive impact of ATOVS was found after about 10 different experiments. The experiments checked the efficiency of mainly channel 5 from both AMSU-A and AMSU-B/MHS and tuning of VarBC coefficients. [[BR]]
 - It turned out that in the verification against observation, only stations at cost lines were used in both Iceland and Greenland. When adding more inland stations over Iceland, the picture on impact of ATOVS radiances have changed. Although, the first results suggest that the forecasts over cost lines are not yet optimal, in general the ATOVS data have positive impact over the Icelandic model domain.[[BR]]
 - Still a clear large bias on surface pressure was observed. Additional blacklisting of local synop stations on T2m and geopotential was worked out. The result of this blacklisting is a clear positive impact on U10m (for all tested thresholds) and precipitation (especially for high precipitating events). At reduction of this minutes, the experiment in ongoing.[[BR]]

 - **Roger** reported about the importance of checking the mf_blacklist.b file before compiling the executable for any experiments. It should provide good blacklisting of bad channels. Note that this can be also controlled through use of the LIST-LOC files. In fact he observed clear negative impact of ATOVS in rapid refresh (RR) run, while in 3-hourly DA cycling no problem was detected. But, the difference between these two test is the chosen period. RUC was tested in 2015, and RR was tested in 2016. in meanwhile the channel 8 from Metop-A was degraded, providing clear problem in 2016. [[BR]]

 - **Joan and Maria** reported that they are testing channels 6 to 9 from AMSU-A with GNSS ZTD in their pre-operational system.[[BR]]

– **GPM GMI, SSMI-S, All-sky radiances:**[[BR]]
  - **Roger** said that they are waiting the CY43 to start the ECMWF solution for All-Sky radiance. [[BR]]
 


– **Infrared instruments:**[[BR]]
**Seviri radiances:** [[BR]]
 - **Magnus** reported that he is working on assimilation of Sevrir radiances in 4D-VAR. The work is progressing well. [[BR]]


– **IASI radiances:**[[BR]]
 - ** Roger** reported that he checked the impact of IASI radiances in rapid refresh system and found positive impact.[[BR]]



– ** VarBC:**[[BR]]
 - **Patrik** reported about the study on set up of VarBC coefficients for LAM with **Mate**. They studied the efficiency of VarBC coefficients estimated in different ways: 1) starting with cold start and zero coefficients; 2) starting with global coefficients and warm start; and 3) using Harris and Kelly scheme.[[BR]]
 - Using cold start 1), they found suspicious values and influence for low peaking (5-7) channels. Also, they need 3 to 4 months to stabilise the coefficients in this case. In this case the scan angle biases are not good enough.[[BR]]
 - Using global coefficients and warm start  2), it needs 1 to 2 weeks to have stable coefficients. In this case scan angle biases are good.[[BR]]
 - Using Harris and Kelly 3), 30 days can provide good parameters. This means that the quality of the bias parameters is similar for the low peaking channels.[[BR]]
 - Their study was limited to the computation of bias coefficients. **Patrik** was encouraged to extend this work to impact study.[[BR]]
 
 - **Roger** mentioned that he published his work on Harris & Kelly, which a copy can be found [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/Idojaras_bias_corr.pdf in Randriamampianina, 2005]

 - **Roger** asked what are the criteria used in this study and what is the main reason of the differences? **Patrik** said that the bias coefficients depend on few things: the number of available observations; the used predictors; the used scheme; the famous NBG, which is the default (5000) in their study; …[[BR]]
 - **Magnus** asked based on 2) above, can one use a coefficients estimated for a neighbouring model domain to start the estimation of new coefficients using warm start? An extended answer to this question can be found in the annex below, when Patrik and Magnus continued the discussion after the meeting.[[BR]]

 - **Patrik** asked **Roger** about his theory based on aggregating the bias coefficients daily. The question was about to neighbouring assimilation times, where one of them covered with good satellite path, while the other one occupied just with a small portion of path. In such a cases, for the small portion of path, if after one month of spin up, the bias is not converging the nominal, **Roger** suggest to blacklist the instrument with small portion. Based on the new finding of **Patrik and Mate**, one can use the coefficients estimated with full path to warm start the coefficients for the small path. Although, we don’t know yet the impact of the warm-start-estimated coefficients, in this case a “iterative” computation of coefficients would help, in the second iteration, the coefficients from the full path can be used to warm-start that of the small path (this is added by Roger after the meeting).[[BR]]
 - **Roger** asked **Patrik** about his idea on using NBG depending on the number active observations at each assimilation time. **Patrik** said that he doesn’t have a final idea about it. It’s well known that large NBG would slow the adaptivity of the scheme, and small NBG would speed. **Patrik** said that for humidity sensitive microwave radiances, slow adaptivity may be better, than a fast one.[[BR]]

– ** Annex:** E-mail from **Patrik** to Magnus after the meeting:[[BR]]
"thanks for the extensive mail. I try to clarify my statements. I put Roger to cc to have possibility to react.[[BR]]

 -**Firstly**, I claim that it is better to initialize the regional VarBC scheme using warmstart rather than coldstart method for the default VarBC setting (nbg=5000). The warmstart method is more beneficial with regards to:
  * the spin-up period (compare [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/FigB.png Fig.B] and [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/FigC.png Fig.C]),
  * no collinearity between predictors
  * better estimation of scan-line and air-mass bias parameters. After one-month spin-up period, we detected better bias correction in terms of O-B departures (BIAS and STD) for the low-peaking AMSU-A channels 5 to 7 using the warmstart method (see Fig.A). The slight degradation of STD of O-B departures using the coldstart method is probably due to underestimated scan-line bias parameters p8-10 ([https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/FigB.png see Fig.B]). The higher adaptivity (as you described in your study) would be beneficial for the coldstart in terms of the correction of BIAS value, however, I wonder about the influence of model biases on the scan-line and air-mass bias parameters (not tested yet).

 -**Secondly**, direct use of global bias parameters in regional VarBC scheme (e.g. MF for polar satellites) is restricted by the following assumptions:
   * radiance bias estimate is similar (spatial resolution, model cycle including forward model, physics, parametrisation asw. ),
   * the same set of predictors,
   * the same satellite data pre-processing.
 - These assumptions are not fulfil for most of regional models, however, I claim that it is beneficial to use the global bias parameters (e.g. Arpege) not directly, but as initial in warmstart and than adapt the bias parameters to the regional model conditions during spin-up period. I think it is possible to initialize your regional VarBC scheme by pre-existing bias parameters from other regional models, however, again it is necessary to use the warmstart method to adapt the bias parameters to your regional model conditions (different at least in terms of model biases).

 -**Finally**, there is questionable how set the adaptivity of bias parameters in the regional VarBC scheme. [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieVideoMeetings/Radiance_data_assimilation/FigD.png Fig.D] presents the time-evolution of bias parameters for a particular MHS channel during the warmstart spin-up period (similar for active data assimilation, but the fluctuation with less extend). High adaptivity is risky in terms of the air-mass and scan-line bias parameter estimate, because too adaptive scheme is able to remove the spatial systematic departures (polynomial scan-line predictors) that are actually related for MHS to humidity errors in the NWP model.

 - At the moment, I'm preparing a paper about an optimal VarBC initialization approach for regional model. How set the adaptivity in passive and active data assimilation is still under investigation. The VarBC adaptivity is in regional model a trade-off between the response to instrument bias changes and the NWP model biases. At the moment, I think that the bias parameter error setting should be dependent on the observation sample, however, this is still a preliminary result."
