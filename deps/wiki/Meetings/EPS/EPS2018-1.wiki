'''Summary of working week'''

* Next EPS working week:
  * At SMHI, Norrköping, Sweden
  * Week 47: 19 - 23 November 2018

* SPPT
  * Little impact seen in earlier SPPT runs
  * Alan: small impact of SPPT
  * Janne: new period chosen because of convective events - a little more impact than seen before
  * Janne: startet to test SPG instead of default pattern generator in SPPT, check that pattern and histogram are OK
    when OK, run with the default settings for the same period as with default SPPT pattern
  * Tweak settings and improve scores! 
  * Alan to join this work later this spring
  * Further work could include: iSPPT, pSPPT, ipSPPT (contact Clemens. Combine common and independent patterns?

* SPP and EPPES:
  * Further work to be based on 40h1.1.1 because the “interesting” parameters are put into namelists already
  * Discussions with Pirkka when we meet in Toulouse at ASM
  * Output of physical tendencies - not general but something we can use in exp. Ongoing (Ole)

* LBC perturbations: status of all experiments and intercomaprison. (Ulf and Henrik)
  * ENS, SLAF and RFP exp are finished, clustering exp ran for one week (Bjorn). 
  * ENS now scores as well as SLAF after the SST fix. 
  * Growth of ENS spread is better
  * RFP is as good as SLAF
  * Ulf is continuing the clustering exp
  * Ulf started a 20 member exp

* HarmonEPS paper: status and who to write what to finish it
  * We aim for the deadline for a first draft as set in the video meeting in January: end of March
  * Alan joins the writing, describing IREPS and possibly SPPT

* Surface perturbations: start work to improve the snow perturbations
  * Andrew introduced Jennie to surface perturbation code
  * Jennie to discuss with surfex experts (Patrick) about how to do snow pert. ++

* Equally likely ensemble members (Åke)
  * exp set up with 4Dvar branch cy40h1.1 that gives files from inner and outer loops
  * Will use LSMIX as a starting point.

* B-rand (Jelena)
  * upgraded to trunk level to make it easier to merge with EPS
  * system works well
  * 3 types of pert: added to the control first guess, pert added to first guess of each member, pert added to the analysis of each member
  * structures of B matrix co-var.
  * Preliminary results added to control first guess: spread too small, when added to first guess of each member spread is too large. 
  * Need weighting function to be tuned
  * uses flow dependent structures for the assimilation.
  * Verification results to come

* EDA (Inger-Lise)
  * Good results for all parameters except clouds. 
  * We get high level clouds when using EDA that are spurious.
  * A report describing the problem is here: 
  * [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/EPS/EPS2018-1/EDA_report_March_2018.pdf Inger-Lise: Report describing the problem]
  * To be investigated further.

* Ensemble calibration (John Bjørnar and Kiri)
  * cont. exploring ways to quantify terrain features, like ridges, valleys, hills, slopes
  * methods: gradient boosting methods for quantiles - it is possible to use in operational setting
  * using MEPS data before new domain
  * will use new MEPS data
  * technical improvements
  * Comparing methods: quantile regression forest and quantile regression neural network - ongoing (T in MEPS for Denmark)

* HARP  
  * Andrew showed what is to come in v3
  * Jose showed that the Opera accumulated precipitation product is currently not good enough to be used for verification
  * Andrew worked on functionality for reading HarmonEPS files in grib and netcdf and for plotting fields

== Transport ==

When you arrive at the airport, buy a Leap Card. These are integrated transport cards used on the majority of public transport around Dublin. More information about the cards and where they can bought can be found [http://www.irishtourist.com/travel-info/leap-card-integrated-ticketing-on-irelands-public-transport/ here].
In order to get to DCU Alpha from the city centre, [https://www.dublinbus.ie/ Dublin Bus] is the easiest way. The stop nearest DCU Alpha is "Glasnevin Hill, Met Office", which is directly opposite our [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_%C3%89ireann#/media/File:Met_ireann_(Irish_Meteorological_Service)_(1387399963).jpg HQ building]. It's a difficult building to miss!

From the city centre, bus numbers 83 and 83a stop directly outside our HQ on the opposite side of the road. Bus numbers 9 and 4 stop nearby at the "Mobhi Road, St. Mobhi Drive" stop. It is then only a 5 minute walk to DCU Alpha.

== Dining near DCU Alpha ==
