 == Notes ==

 * '''Surface perturbations:''' 

 Encouraging to see in Henrik’s presentation that the surface perturbations could trigger convection.

 Surface perturbations was tested with surface assimilation for all members or only for the control '''(Andrew, Björn, Janne, Inger-Lise and Ulf)''', and we see a clear benefit from surface assimilation for all members. However, the variation in the members biases gets larger. This was tested in MEPS-setup, and it is not necessarily the same conclusion for a COMEPS-setup. 

 '''Further work:'''

 '''AEMET''' will study the effect of perturbing the SST (in a different way) and the Roughness Length for case studies of severe weather over the Iberian Peninsula and compare those perturbations with a setup where all set of perturbations in the scheme is used. The main focus in 2018 will be SST perturbations and its influence on convection by varying the length scale and the standard deviation of the perturbations. Similarities and differences on the precipitation field at different lead times among all ensemble members will be analyzed. After testing on several case studies, a longer period could be run (under discussion). '''(Ongoing: Alberto)'''

 '''DMI:''' Surface perturbations are now included in pre-operational COMEPS. Henrik presented some new ideas for surface perturbations (see his presentation for details). DMI will look into interesting cases from summer 2017. '''(Ongoing: Henrik)'''

 '''MetCoOp:''' Focus on cases studies, and test different settings in the perturbations scheme. If Norway gets funding for an external project they have applied for, work on snow-, ice- and targeted SST-perturbations will start. 
 We should aim at verifying 1h precipitation, the challenge is the observation availability. '''(Action: Andrew, Rafael and Janne)'''

 * '''SPPT:'''

 Implementation in HarmonEPS following Alfons’ suggestions '''(Done: Ulf, SPPT namelist switches introduced in [16450])'''.

 Work on LAM-formulation of SPPT, which is not correct in the current implementation '''(Action: Alfons)'''
 
 In parallel SPPT tests are ongoing in HarmonEPS '''(Janne and Inger-Lise)'''. Next year, when '''Alan''' has Hirlam-time, he will also work on SPPT with the aim to implement developments that other LAM consortia has done, and to test setups of SPPT that is suitable for HarmonEPS. Things to consider: amplitude of perturbations, spatial and temporal correlation scales, include multiple scales (like in IFS). 

 A wiki-page will be constructed for the SPPT work '''(Action: Inger-Lise)'''. 


 * '''SPP:''' 

 A first implementation for coupling one parameter (VSIGQSAT) to the SPPT pattern to allow for spatial and temporal correlations was done before the working week and tested (Ulf and Inger-Lise). 

 This implementation is also to be tested for parameter rlcrit and compared to earlier tests where rlcrit was varied stochastically between members and cycles, but kept constant in time and space '''(Action: Sibbo. Technical work done)'''. 

 It was agreed to implement a IFS-like SPP framework in HarmonEPS '''(Action: Ulf)'''. A first trial with VSIGQSAT as example parameter is implemented and tested on cca. The code is available under {{{ecgb:~snh/hm_home/spp}}}. '''Ongoing'''

 A normal distribution was used for the first attempt at perturbing VSIGQSAT, but it was agreed that in further testing we should use log-normal distribution like it is done in IFS.

 A somewhat arbitrary value for the spatial and temporal correlations was used in the first trial, so in further tests different settings for this will be investigated. This will be tried for a few, selected parameters '''(Action: Inger-Lise)'''. Experiments to be run for two weeks, for one summer (26 May 2017 - 8 June 2017) and one winter (30 Dec 2015 - 12 Jan 2016) period. 

 Need to review the list of parameters, and contact relevant experts again '''(Action: Inger-Lise)'''. 

 Verification will be done in the normal way by using Harp, but also looking at the tendencies as a diagnostic tool '''(Action: Pirkka and Inger-Lise)'''. 

 A wiki-page will be constructed for the SPP work '''(Action: Inger-Lise)'''. 

 * '''Output of physics tendencies:'''
 For use as diagnostic tool when developing SPP the total physical tendencies will be used. '''(Action Ole: get the physical tendencies as output from HarmonEPS)'''.

 * '''EPPES:'''

 Work on HarmonEPS framework to start this year '''(Action: Pirkka)'''

 * '''SPG:'''

 SPG was implemented by Mihály Szűcs in Arome cy38, implement in HarmonEPS-40h1.1 '''(Ongoing: Ole)'''

 * '''SLAF vs ENS'''
    * A new comparison between using SLAF or ENS (now with hourly output) is ongoing and preliminary results was shown by Ulf. SLAF is still better than using ENS. Could this be because SLAF is sampling analysis increments, and that is not too far from analysis error which is what we theoretically should sample (Ole)? One thing noticed is that ENS MSLP is always positive. This is strange, as we should see the +/- structure. Diagnosis to be repeated without the interpolation to the Harmonie grid '''(Action: Ulf)'''. '''Update: ENS vs. SLAF runs finished, and SLAF is better than ENS.'''
    * '''Further work will include''' 
      * Revisiting of the clustering: Earlier tests with clustering of ENS (the clustering was done for u,v,z,q for 850/700/500hPa and +24 and +36) for use as initial perturbations and lateral boundary conditions showed little impact on spread for variables other than MSLP, where the spread was increased so much that it became too big. It could be that the reason for this was that the clustering was done to high up in the atmosphere. When this study was done, we decided to wait with further tests until we had available the ENS data with hourly output, which we have now (Ulf). '''Ongoing Bjørn:''' test the clustering algorithm for the period when hourly ENS data is saved, try different settings for the clustering variable (like clustering lower down in the atmosphere).
      * Include surface perturbations and rerun
      * Run a summer period.

 If SLAF continues to be better than using ENS, it is difficult to argue that we should replace it in an operational setting. However, there are limitations on the number of members that you can have in your ensemble with SLAF, as you run out of old high res forecasts. One possibility is to use the same perturbations for the longest forecasts, or as AEMET does, to use multi boundaries. 

 Automatic scaling of K-values in SLAF to be included in HarmonEPS-40h1.1. '''(Ongoing: Henrik)'''

 * '''EDA:'''

 No news. We need to finish the study started a year ago … '''(Action: Roger and Inger-Lise)'''

 * '''LETKF:'''

 How to merge with 4Dvar and EPS branches? '''Pau''' merges with 4Dvar branch. 4Dvar will be part of cy40h1.2 so when cy40h1.2 is available (planned for late March 2018) we will have both EPS and LETKF availble in cy40h1.2. 

 How to use is described in Pau’s presentation. More testers are welcome!

 * '''Equally likely ensemble members:'''
 Åke is waiting for 4DVar to work properly.

 * '''Calibration'''
    * A new 10-month dataset including about 12 variables from MEPS has been prepared. Further, spatial information has been created from the EU-DEM elevation data (30 m resolution) and the Corine Land Cover data (~100 m resolution). Observations are extracted from the MEPS BUFR files, but only a few variables (temperature and wind speed) are currently available. '''(JBB)''' 
    * '''Thomas''' started looking at using solar radiation from MEPS as a predictor in the calibration of temperature in MEPS. It is theorized that this predictor combined with the high resolution land/ocean information from the land cover data can yield better downscaled temperatures in coastal areas.
    * '''Jesus''' is testing Glameps calibration methods on gSREPS for T2m and S10m. In February, Jesus will begin to calibrate precipitation with QRF.
