     * Alex Deckmyn, a short course on setting up stand-alone GLAMEPS verification (to be corrected)
       1. export R_VERSION=2.15.1; use R
       1. on ecgate, do mkdir -p $srcdir
       1. cd $srcdir; tar xf ~cv6/GLAMEPS/export/VerifExport.tar
       1. cd !VerifExport; vi ASMSenv
       1. edit Rtable.ksh
         * Run Rtable.ksh to create Rtable from archived GLAMEPS model data (in the future this will be in SQLite format)
       1. Prepare for verification
         * adapt, if necessary, scr/Rsetup-verif.R 
         * edit RVerif_noplot.ksh
         * perform Rverif_noplot.ksh to compute verification scores by comparing model-derived Rtable against those of observation
          * Results are in R-list object. In the future this will be changed into SQLite format.     
          * Results will contain dozens of scores: ETS, ROC, CRPS...and in files like Verifdata_T2m.Rdata, which can be used for plot.
       1. Plotting: manually from R, scripts to come later
 * Friday
   * 0900-1200  Working session. Wrap-up of working week.

== Preparations ==

* !WiFi access will be available. Preferably, people should bring their own laptop. Please let us know in advance if this is not possible.
 
* How to get to RMI

The easiest way to reach the hotel from the airport is to take the train (underground level in the airport). Stop at the Brussels South
(Bruxelles-Midi) Station. From there, take the tram 4, direction “STALLE” and stop at “HEROS – HELDEN”. You are 1-minute walk from your
hotel.


The Institute can be reached easily by bus 43, direction “OBSERVATOIRE-STERRENWACHT”. Take it to a few meters from the hotel
(cross Avenue De Fré) and stop at the terminus. See attached files at the bottom of this page (Map_Hotel_Heros.gif and
Hotel-2-RMI.png)

A single bus ticket costs 2,50 euro, which can be purchased on the bus; after validation, it can be used for any bus or tram connections during
1 hour.

Tickets for 10 journeys €11,80 are also available (e.g. in the station), but not on the bus.

You can also walk from the hotel to IRM. It is about 1.5 km (uphill!).
