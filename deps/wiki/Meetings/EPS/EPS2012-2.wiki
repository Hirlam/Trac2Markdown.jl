== Purpose ==

This is the second GLAMEPS/HarmonEPS working week for this year, Following are the main headlines

 1. GLAMEPS TCF Opt 2 at ECMWF.
 1. Hindcast-experiments for future GLAMEPS_v2
 1. Preparing for a deep convection permitting EPS, HarmonEPS.
 1. Post-processing and Ensemble calibration.
 1. Verification issues

In addition a side meeting is arranged between Oct 31 and 2 Nov 2012 with focus on ALADIN-HIRLAM collaboration on development of verification tools.

== Preparations ==

 * How to get to DMI
DMI-headquarter is located in the immediate vicinity of Ryparken S-train station, 2 zones away from central railway station and 3 zones from Copenhagen airport. Ryparken station is most conveniently reachable by S-train with line A or H toward FARUM direction. After arriving to Ryparken, exit from the southern end and use the stairs to the left that leads directly up to the DMI. When approaching reception, tell the staff that you come for the GLAMEPS/HIRLAM working week. Kai Sattler and Xiaohua Yang are local contact persons.

Address: Danish Meteorological Institute, Lyngbyvej 100, 2100 Copenhagen. Phone 39 15 75 00
 * Hotel options: Participants are suggested to do their own booking via internet. The following two are hotels in central Copenhagen that have been commonly used by HIRLAM colleagues visiting DMI, with reasonable prices and relatively convenient transportation to DMI and to airport.
