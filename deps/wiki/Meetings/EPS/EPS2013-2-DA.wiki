= '''Hirlam-B/ALADIN Working Week on DA & EPS 2013.''' =
''MET Norway, Oslo. Monday 4 November - Friday 8 November. ''

[[Center(end)]]

== Purpose ==

The purpose of the HIRLAM/ALADIN joint working week on DA and EPS is to initiate closer collaboration between DA and EPS communities  in HIRLAM consortia and to achieve better understanding of challenges, problems and achievements in these two direction of reserach. The  emphasis is on the novel developments in both areas and on the priorities for the longer term algorithmic investments. The specific problems will be addressed as well in parallel sessions. The ultimate goal is the design of the consistent EPS-DA system for convection permitting scales.
 
Following are the main headlines:

 1. Long-term algorithmic investments in HIRLAM consortia
   a. flow-dependent DA framework (2DEnsVAR, 4DEnsVAR versus 4DVAR Hybrid, HARMONIE AROME/ALARO 4DVAR, Gaussian Quadrature 4DVAR, low regularization norm)
   b. LAM specific issues (extension zone, Jk constraint, control of LBC)
   c. Phase (non-additive)-error correction (image warping, "super-hybrid" /synthesis of image warping and hybrid VAR ,  hybrid "FA + 3DVAR" for radar data )  
 1. Development of consistent EPS-DA system
 1. Operational GLAMEPS.
 1. Hindcast-experiments for future GLAMEPS_v2
 1. HarmonEPS experiments.
 1. Post-processing and Ensemble calibration.
 1. Verification issues

== Preparations ==

* Wired network access will be available. Preferably, people should bring their own laptop. Please let us know in advance if this is not possible.
 
== How to get here ==

* From airport to hotel:
From airport to down-town Oslo: Either take the Airport Express train or a regional train (NSB) from the airport to down-town Oslo and get off at Oslo S (Oslo central station). The regional trains are a bit cheaper and only take a few more minutes, but they are not as frequent as the Airport Express trains. For information about regional train times visit https://www.nsb.no/?lang=en_US with "Oslo Lufthavn" as departure place and "Oslo S" as arriving place. Please note that you have to decide on what train company to use (NSB or Express train) as the tickets can not be used on both companies. NSB machines have red details and Airport Express train have orange details, they are also labelled of course. Then either walk from Oslo S to the hotel, see map under "Attachments", or take the Metro one station to Stortinget and walk from there.

NSB machines have red details and Airport Express train have orange details, they are also labelled of course. Then to come to MET Norway you continue with Metro line 3, 4 or 6 (direction west). Get off at "Forskningsparken" station. Follow the signposted footpath to Forskningsparken main entrance. When entering the building follow the corridor slightly to the right of the entrance along the building to the end, there you will find the entrance to MET Norway Research department.

== Train tickets ==
You buy them in ticket machines at the airport. Note that there are two different train companies that goes from the Airport to down-town Oslo, and make sure you but the right ticket, see above on how to get here for details.

== Metro tickets ==
You need to buy tickets before you enter the Metro. Machines are available. For details on prices and types of tickets visit:  https://ruter.no/en/tickets/
