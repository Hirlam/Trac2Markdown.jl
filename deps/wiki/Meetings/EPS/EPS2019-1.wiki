== Summary ==
* HarmonEPS paper - looked at the review in detail and all questions have assigned people to update the manuscript accordingly. Deadline is 11 June, so everybody to have their contributions ready by end of May.
* cy43 testing 
  * See attachment for what will be tested and who will do what: [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/EPS/EPS2019-1/Testing_of_EPS_components_in_cy43.pdf Testing of EPS components in cy43]
    * Ulf: BND/PertAna OK, EDA technically OK, clustering OK, surface perturbations ok. Misc. updates including new default setup.
    * Karoliina and Janne: SPPT testing started
    * Inger-Lise: EDA testing to start next week
    * Ole: SPG compiles and work technically with SPPT=yes
    * Jelena: debugging of BRAND and EnVar
*  Calibration (JBB) based on millions of training cases and operational prediction at millions of grid points are computationally very challenging, in particular for methods like quantile regression forests (random forest). In this regard stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) may be a good alternative, since less complex models often are sufficient. Selection of tuning parameters in SGB has been investigated with respect to deterministic forecast quality (23% improvement of MAE for temperature), computational requirements and model complexity. Preliminary results are promising, but it is not straightforward to make probabilistic forecasts. By making separate models for the mean and variance, forecasts in terms of two-parameter distributions can be made, though. Future work include how to make probabilistic forecasts and setting up an experimental system making temperature forecasts at a 500m grid, say.
* SPP and SPPT: 
  * For SPPT testing of different SDEV are ongoing (Alan, Janne and Karoliina). 
  * For SPP Ulf has implemented two new radiation parameters. 
  * Inger-Lise is currently testing zl_inf. 
  * A SPP testing plan for a winter period was made, and Sibbo, Pirkka and Inger-Lise will run  the same as was done for the summer period, some runs were stared this week. 
  * When happy with SPP settings two longer periods will be run for both SPP and SPPT, one winter and one summer period. 
  * Ideas on how to use tendencies for diagnosing the perturbations were discussed. 
  * For SPPT we would like to implement and test pSPPT. 
  * A combination of SPP and SPPT will be tried. 
  * We aim to start writing a paper about SPP and SPPT this summer. 
* Harp-v3: Andrew has worked on speed-up at ecgate, good progress but still a little remaining
* Humidity bias seen in perturbed members: Henrik has started to investigate this. In a first set of experiments humidity impact was tested in PertAna, by reducing them or switching them off. Results needs to be studied more. Next steps to test same in boundaries and in surface perturbations. 
* Discussions with Jan B about KNMI contributions to HIRLAM EPS work
* Andrew and John had discussion about work on perturbing surface fluxes, work to start in the autumn.
* NEXT WORKING WEEK: 11. -15. November 2019 (week 46), Barcelona.




== Block hotel reservation ==
A block hotel reservation has been made in Star Lodge (situated between Utrecht and De Bilt; there are bus stops close to the hotel with direct connections to KNMI and Utrecht central station). The costs are 87.50 EUR per room per night, including breakfast, excluding taxes. You can book a room with the code EPSKNMI2019 on their website (https://www.starlodgehotelsutrecht.nl/en/hotel-utrecht.html).

== How to reach KNMI ==
See https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/how-to-contact-knmi. Please note that you have to enter via the main entrance gate of KNMI along the Utrechtseweg (number 297), because the other gate (at the Wilhelminalaan) is not open momentarily.
