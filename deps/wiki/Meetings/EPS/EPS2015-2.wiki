    * performance
 1. Calibration of GLAMEPS and HarmonEPS

    * Calibration for precipitation, can we use what is developed for yr.no?
 1. HarmonEPS perturbation experiments / HarmonEPS system
    * EDA with 3D-Var
    * MSG cloud mask perturbations, stochastic perturbations to “freezing probability per unit time”. Perturb (stochastically) the thresholds for autoconversion.
    * Experiment with perturbations of surface parameters (e.g. soil moisture, albedo, snow, SST, LAI, vegetation fraction, roughness length and soil temperature)
    * Surface physics: study perturbations in momentum, heat and moisture flux parameterizations
    * LBC studies
    * SLAF perturbations

    * .....

       * Working session
 * Thursday
     * Excursion to Izaña Observatory and volcano Teide
 * Friday
     * Working session
     * Wrap-up discussions and close of working week
       * GLAMEPS v2.
         * Things appear normal from HARP shiny interface and monitoring of monthly comparison of control suites. Especially, calibrated T2m and W10m seemed to be generally positive. Bias trend since May month has been in right direction also. It is suggested to use calibrated T2m and W10m in the default GLAM-o-gram pages, this to swap with the uncalibrated one, the latter to be in alternative pages.
         * Calibration team.
       * GLAMEPS v3
         * An urgent current issue for v3 is the dramatically increased cost and delivery time seen from the initial test of HIRLAM components (increase of 4 nodes to max of 22 nodes for HIRLAM components in v3 in order for normal delivery). After discussion, the fresh test, mainly through use of HGS server, seemed to have returned the cost to be roughly within expectation. ( 9 nodes for v2 vs v3 HIRLAM component with similar delivery).  Ole continues explore possibility of running HIRLAM with hybrid mpi-opm parallelisation.
         * It is agreed that for ALARO members in v3, the first priority is to get it technically working with the current version (CY37). Then the addition of model error perturbation with horizontal diffusion. After these it can be considered about adding inflation to ECMWF ENS perturbation, and upgrade of ALARO 0 to ALARO 1.
         * ALARO-ISBA (CY37) crashed in Alex's initial forecast test and question about problem in climate generation is raised. To help diagnosing problem Xiaohua used HARMONIE 38h1.2 to generate climate files for ISBA and SURFEX components and have sent to Alex for comparison. The HARMONIE test with 38h1.2 also indicate that ALARO ISBA on glameps-v3 domain can deliver in time with about use of 10 nodes.

You make the reservations yourself emailing to reservas<at>jardin-tropical.com reference AEMET (don't forget the reference). Please send to Jose (jgarciamoyaz<at>aemet.es) copy of the email.
Note that you MUST book the hotel in this way (and not use booking.com), this is due to price for meeting room facilities. 

* How to get there:
