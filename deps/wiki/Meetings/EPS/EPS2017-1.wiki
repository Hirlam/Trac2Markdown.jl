== Notes ==

 * HarmonEPS system:
   * Update harmonEPS-40h1.1 with latest changes:
     * Possibility to run with different length scale for different parameters in the surface perturbation code: '''DONE'''. Committed and technically tested.
     * ECMWF environment fixes: '''DONE'''
     * Fix bug in archiving of vobs files on ecfs: '''DONE'''
     * Fix MARS_prefetch bug using erroneous forecast length for members: '''DONE'''
     * Add extra cloud fields to fullpos output: '''DONE'''
     * perturbation length scale and stdv. clipping to be set individually for each parameter: '''DONE'''
     * Add extra cloud variables to cloud verification: '''DONE'''
     * Get the clustering algorithm into HarmonEPS branch - '''ongoing'''
     * BDSTRATEGY=eps_ec_oper - include possibility to use the operational ENS in HarmonEPS - '''ongoing'''
     * Surface perturbation fixes - with/without assimilation - '''DONE'''
     * Easier to start run from spinup data - include in EPS branch - '''ongoing''' (will come with harmonEPS-40h1.2)
     * Avoid having to write all history files to produce the wanted output (make possible from fp-files): '''DONE'''
   * Other developments:
   * Include CA pattern for parameter perturbations:'''DONE'''
   * Prepare for EPPES: '''not started'''
 * SPPT:
   * get SPPT to run in cy40
     * Applying http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/aladin/IMG/pdf/wc-2nov2015.pdf as suggested by Ulf Andrae. '''Solved'''
   * pattern suitable for LAM
     * Before coding a pattern generator suitable for LAM, saving pattern generator into ouput GRIBs, as a DEFAULT output and as well for further testings as GFL outputs. '''ongoing'''
 * Surface perturbations
   * Alberto is running an experiment over Spanish domain with perturbing SST, 150km length scale and clipping of random fields to ±4 with parameter standard deviations halved. For cases with heavy convection. '''Ongoing'''
   * Henrik has run with surface perturbations on for a period in August-September 2015. Reference not run yet.  Run for a period in November 2015 has also been started. '''ongoing'''
   * Reduced number of perturbed parameters OK?
     * A very small degradation in the overall scores when not perturbing the parameters SNOW(WSN_VEG1), LAI, VEG and Vegetation Thermal Inertia
       Coefficient (CV). Case studies from run with reduced set not conclusive. Test performed because we trust these perturbations less. See Janne's presentation. '''DONE''' [[https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/EPS/EPS2017-1/Surface_perturbations_mod.pdf|Surface perturbations]]
   * Further development and experiments:
     * Discussed if we need a new summer period with more convective cases for the runs made over MetCoOp domain. Morten K will look into the current period to check occurrence of convection. Probably a new summer period is needed: '''Action Andrew''': come up with a suggestion for a new period.
     * Surface perturbations with/without surface assimilation?
       * Errors in the first experiments. '''Action Björn''': code changes to use the surface control analysis for all members. '''Ongoing'''. 
       * When this code changes are in place the winter period (2015123006 - 2016011906) will be run with surface assimilation for the control only and with surface perturbations on. To be compared with Sfc_Pert_SLAF_MetCoOp (note long run on 06 UTC). '''Action: Björn''' 
       * When new period is chosen and the code changes above are in place a new set of experiments over the MetCoOp domain will be run for the new summer period:
         * Reference run (no surface perturbations) with surface assimilation for control only (long run at 00 UTC). '''Action: Janne'''
         * Surface assimilation for control only, surface perturbations on, length scale 150km (long run at 00 UTC). Reduced set of perturbations? Decision: turn off SNOW (it is summer), reduce magnitude of LAI (unrealistically large values for summer), keep VEG (switch off for a case to see impact), keep CV. '''Action: Andrew'''
 * Parameter perturbations:
   * Include CA pattern: '''ongoing'''
   * Next experiment will be to test perturbing VSIGQSAT with CA pattern. 
 * Nesting strategies:
   * ENS vs SLAF: See Ulf's presentation: [[https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/EPS/EPS2017-1/Revisiting%20the%20usage%20of%20ENS%20boundaries%20instead%20of%20SLAF.pdf|ENS 4 times a day and hourly bd-data vs. SLAF ]]. 
    * In this experiment spread for MSLP is too big. Turned off inflation of perturbation in '''ongoing''' experiment.
    * Ulf's experiments with SLAF and ENS to be rerun with surface perturbations switched on '''not started'''
    * After which clustering of ENS will be tested. '''not started'''
   * Henrik working on scaling SLAF perturbations using total energy norm. '''ongoing'''
  * Initial conditions perturbations.  "Brand" (random perturbations in control vector space with the structure of B-matrix covariance) experiment with the default settings has been running for two weeks period (June 2012). Space-scale decomposition is tried on Brand ensemble with encouraging results. Perturbations are added to the analysis of control and evolved by non-linear model. Alternative approach is to perturb first guess and use unperturbed observations to keep the ensemble members together. Ensemble will be evaluated using both probabilistic and deterministic scores as well as in the structure functions space. HARP verification package is installed successfully. Inflation algorithm need to be developed. Close similarite with the ETKF rescaling perturbations approach. Work is '''on-going''' 
* GLAMEPS and v3
   * The difference in T2m bias between control and members is bigger in HIR-ensembles in V3 than in V2, which looks suspicious. For this reason the inflation of the perturbations was switched off 9. May. Verification of ~10 days show that this is still the case. Decided to switch off CAPS-SV and run for ~1.5 week and look at verification again. '''Action: Kai and Toon, Andrew to do the verification'''. In parallel look at monitor-verification for the period where the inflation was switched off, to possibly spot suspicious behavior in eg surface assimilation. '''Action: Xiaohua'''
   * HAC recommends that GLAMEPS should continue for 2 more years without any further development.
 * Calibration:
   * John Bjørnar has investigated methods to better model spatial variations. New R code has been made that uses random forests to create new predictors for the main regression model. A brief test on temperature +36h for May - October 2015 showed that the CRPSS was increased from about 8% (operational calibration) to 13%, while the number of sites with positive CRPSS increased from 83% to 93%.  
   * Kirien compared the skill for wind speed forecasts using the Box-Cox t-distribution and quantile regression forests. QRF is generally more skilful than the BCT (improved CRPSS at ~85% of stations for QRF compared to ~76% of stations for BCT; Worked on computing a new predictor (distance from the coast) for each station; Compared skill and computation time for QRF models fit with varying number of trees, node size and training sample size
   * Kaisa has adapted the GLAMEPS calibration code to work with systems at FMI for predicting temperature, wind, wind gust, and precipitation using ECMWF over Europe.  
   * Jesus fixed issues in the framework for EUMETNET. He will start testing the calibration of gSREPS using the GLAMEPS methods.
   * Thomas has implemented the calibration of precipitation (both training and prediction) to be included in V2. He will coordinate with Toon to include it in the operations.
   * It was decided to use local HamonEPS suites for the development of the calibration software, if available. Otherwise use GLAMEPS.
 * EPS verification
   * Andrew has rewritten large parts of HARP for better functionality. See [[https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/EPS/EPS2017-1/What's%20happening%20in%20HARP.pdf | presentation]]. This needs to be discussed with Bent and Alex. '''Action: Andrew'''
   * implementing the U.UI spread/skill relationship into HARP/Shiny with due account of observation-inhomogeneities and the Desroziers et. al corrections. '''Ongoing work. In order to test and evaluate the code that has been developed on real forecast data Andrew will provide one week of GLAMEPS data'''
