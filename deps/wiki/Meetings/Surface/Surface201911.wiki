'''Please add items'''

 * Next meteorological release of cy43h2.1...
   * ...is planned for spring 2020. [wiki:Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1 The targets testing for this is described on this wiki]. Based on the outcome of the targets tests so far, Tuesday October 1st HIRLAM MG decided that next release will based on target2, i.e. not including ECOCLIMAP Second Generation (ECOSG). But at the same time HIRLAM MG acknowledged that ECOSG is the strategic future for HARMONIE-AROME and that we should have the goal to combine new surface physics with ECOSG.
   * Although target 2 performs quite well with respect to cy40h1.1.1 there are still some aspects that should be improved before a release. Exactly what we don't know yet since the results of all targets tests are not available yet, but the list so far concerns:
      * We should increase XRIMAX from current =0 to probably =0.2 but also in possible combination with modified exchange coefficients and/or in combination with an [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/Diagnostics_development alternative T2m diagnostics (N2M=3)].
      * In HIRLAM, 2-metre temperature issues were strongly reduced after the [http://www.hirlam.org/index.php/publications-54/hirlam-newsletters-a/doc_download/131-hirlam-newsletter-no-54-paper-06-sass Sass and Woetmann Nielsen (Hirlam Newsletter 54, 2008)] modification of the Geleyn (1988) 2-metre temperature diagnostic formula for stable boundary layers was applied.
      * [https://www.dmi.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/Rapporter/TR/2017/DMIRep17-24-n.pdf Niels Woetmann Nielsen (2017)], DMI, has made an analytical solution for stably stratified surface boundary layers that depends only on the bulk Richardson number.
      * Rsmin has been increased to avoid excess transpiration but results indicate that summer-autumn season is now a bit too warm (and dry). Thus, a less increase of Rsmin is under testing. [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/First_cy43h_setup#ModifiedvaluesofminimumstomatalresistanceRsmin See more info here].
   * Tests with modifications beyond target specifications are ongoing.
     * [wiki:Harmonie_43h2/Validation_for_tagging_43h2.1#Modifiedtargetexperiments Outcome of ongoing XRIMAX-related tests are available here].
     * Activation of OROTUR has been proven beneficial (or even needed) for the AEMET domain due to overestimation of U10m. At least AEMET should have this active in an operational cy43h2.1.   
   * What additional development should be considered for a cy43h2.1 release:
     * Katya is working on CANARI improvements related to the [wiki:Meetings/Surface/Surface201805#CANARIissues list of issues we discussed in Tromsø]. Katya is preparing a suggested set of CANARI updates for a cy43h2.1 release.
     * LR 26 Oct: CANARI corrections and Mariken's (CARRA) work on satellite snow cover data assimilation will allow development and testing of the use of HYDROSAF snow extent data in analysis. This is clearly beyond the cy43h2.1 release but work should be done in CY43 framework. Our FMI EUMETSAT/hydrosaf colleagues are preparing a new way to provide global snow extent data, so called snow barrels, to be left by the satellite along the track for collection by NWP models. Barrels would contain within agreed resolution (e.g. 10 x 10 or 20 x 20 km boxes independently on lat-lon coordinates) the amount of pixels containing snow, no snow, partial snow. This is believed to be especially useful at high latitudes where screening of data could be simplified when the convergence of longitudes will not be an issue anymore.
     * Bolli and Kristian, the snow albedo improvements that were introduced in CARRA can be useful for operational cy43 setups. However, the opportunity window to include these updates as part of an official release of cy43h2.1 closes fast... At least I think we need to see these updates as an option in cy43-develop-branch + some tests based on that if they should be considered. Do you have time to look into this? Anyway, even if it may be too late to have these improvements as part of an official release I guess they would be of interest for some cy43h2.1 domains...  

 * Our next big step forward will be to introduce new land-surface physics (diffusion soil, explicit snow, Multi-Energy Balance) in combination with SEKF assimilation, TITAN/gridPP and ECOSG. What is the status:
   * All new [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/New_SURFEX_options_cy43h surface physics settings according to this list] are now available. [wiki:HarmonieClimate/HCLIM43 At the HCLIM43 wiki Samuel describes what the new surface physics now consists of]. Hopefully we will have some results from the Iberia domain to look into when we meet in Ireland. Any other climate setups running as well?
   * In NWP mode the new physics is planned to be combined with SEKF for surface assimilation. Here Åsmund is the main developer and he has a branch of cy43h for this [https://git.hirlam.org/users/asmundb/Harmonie] (branch develop). Also John is looking into SEKF in combination with an evapotranspiration product (LSA-SAF).
   * The SEKF development in cy43h is now built upon analysis with TITAN/gridPP (and not on CANARI). Is this the setup we head for when we release a new HARMONIE-AROME version with new surface physics and SEKF? If yes, is TITAN/gridPP ready for that or are there aspects of TITAN/gridPP that need development to fulfil operational needs?
   * A few reports evaluating ECOSG itself show that EGOSG in general is more realistic than earlier ECOCLIMAP versions. See e.g. [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201901/ECOCLIMAP_v2.2-SG.pptx presentation by John] and [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oFu1isfblfDSzVfYgT-o-DyoODzjq1nQ report by Katya]. However, in tg1 tests ECOSG gives too high wind speed for some domains which is related to a combined effect of changes in tree height, changes in forest/open-land fractions and changes in LAI. Probably a tuning is needed applied e.g. to tree height and roughness length for grass...

 * Physiography
   * Our global physiography products evolve (e.g. SOILGRID and ECOSG) but we have not yet found an efficient way forward to handle updates of the global products when problems are identified and how to combine them with regional non-global products. A discussion around this is planned for the working week...

 * About tests where Swedish lakes Lake Vänern and Vättern are treated by FLake and not from NEMO. Laura, a while ago you said "One-month quick validation in December 2018 did not reveal any differences between FLake-Nemo experiment in terms of standard scores. Experiments are still running…". So, do we need to look beyond standard scores to understand any differences...?
 Comment LR 26 Oct: I could give a short lake update, including a review of the recent Lake2019 workshop in Toulouse: http://www.meteo.fr/cic/meetings/2019/LAKE2019/, see also a report of the workshop [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nv8l5Ciz8odSeTACg96jgtSc3NWYKCoN  by Margarita] and my [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201911/Rontu_Lake19.pdf presentation] at the workshop. My Vänern and Vättern experiments are stuck on 20th of January 2019, so there is 2 months of data to be analysed (unfortunately, I have not done such an analysis yet). 

 * Glacier parametrisation based on the Explicit snow scheme
   * Plans on how to proceed...

 * Evaluation of ORORAD
   * Since HIRLAM decided to build cy43h on SURFEX8.1 from the SURFEX repository we do not have ORORAD on board. ORORAD will become available in a SURFEXv9 release (now available in a development version of v9 code in SURFEX branch SURFEX_V9_DEV). So, what is our plan, to update our cy43h SURFEX code to SURFEXv9 when it appears or wait with this until cy46h setup? Is it meaningful to test ORORAD offline meanwhile...? Comment LR 7.11.2019: Let us wait for v9 in cy46h, then check the code and setup to be suggested by MF specialists, do offline tests only if needed for this process. 

 * The longer term plan involves replacing SEKF with EnKF step wise in 1D, 2D, 3D
   * We have activities by e.g. Tomas (SMHI) developing and testing this in an offline SURFEX environment. Also the SURFEX team (Clément Albergel) and Jostein Blyverket (NILU) are woring on EnKF methods. We plan a separate working group with EnKF surface people next year.

=== Monday November 11 ===

The intention is to utilize this day mainly for work in different group constellations for those who arrive during the weekend and also for traveling
for those who prefer to travel on a weekday.

 * 14:30-16:30 Physiography meeting: A few very physiography oriented colleagues have agreed to have a meeting on physiography issues. Everyone is welcome to join of course!
   * Preliminary items for discussion by Patrick:
     * Should we have common principles for building of new global data sets? E.g., we have now two versions of SOILGRIDS sand/clay. One in cy43 based on tiff-files (work by Laura, Matti) and on the side a complement of this including local changes over Iceland and Denmark (right?) in ordinary PGD input format (right?). Also, now we have a new soil-organic carbon data set prepared by Åsmund based also on SOILGRIDS and tiff-files. The preprocessing of tiff-files works well in HARMONIE but these data sets are not directly available for any offline SURFEX setups. Is that a problem? And about documentation, can we reproduce what Matti and Åsmund have done without their involvement?
     * How should we do with regional (non-global) data sets? Don't try to glue them into common global data sets is my suggestion but rather provide tools for those who wish to locally update their data... Or?
     * In ECOSG the soil depth is specified per cover (21 different) but is this soil depth realistic? Question marks have been raised about too deep soil depth for e.g. Scandinavia and Iceland which would overestimate the soil water holding capacity. Is there alternative soil depth data available?
     * For UWC some of us are involved in writing a proposal for how UWC should work with physiography. How to proceed?

== Memory notes ==

=== cy43h2.1 target tests ===

'''XRIMAX:'''

 * We believe that a combination of increased XRIMAX (possibly =0.2), modified exchange coefficients (Cd, Ch) for the stable case and a modified T2m diagnostics formulation is the recipe for success. 
 * Patrick will investigate the possibility to get both observed forcing data for SURFEX and corresponding observed validation data (surface temperature and T2m) for a northern Europe open-land site suitable to study the stability problem. With such data it would be possible to study the stability problem in SURFEX offline setup.
 * Mariken will do further sensitivity tests with increased XRIMAX, modified exchange coefficients (Cd, Ch) and a modified T2m diagnostics formulation.
 * Kristian will do sensitivity tests including also modified Gelyn formulation a la HIRLAM and new surface layer turbulence formulation a la Nils Woetman Nielsen.
 * We would like to see an increased XRIMAX as a default setting combination in a cy43h2.1 release but if we cannot reach a conclusion on how such a setting combination should look before a release is expected we will recommend HIRLAM partners to use an increased XRIMAX setting if it seems beneficial for their domain.

'''Rsmin:'''

 * Results are quite mixed but there is a tendency that we are a bit too dry during daytime during the active vegetation period. Therefore we will test half of the increase in Rsmin in sensitivity studies.

'''OROTUR:'''

 * AEMET will consider OROTUR as a tool to decrease their positive wind bias.

'''CARRA development:'''

 * Climatology of permanent snow albedo can possibly be entered under a switch in cy43h2.1 but needs to be confirmed with Daniel Santos first. The same is valid for D95 prognostic albedo formulation (switch).

 * Prepare for experiments with assimilation of satellite-based snow extent in cy43 (hidden under a switch); transfer carra implementation to cy43, Bator changes to read satellite snow extent from OBSOUL files and prepare H-SAF satellite snow extent for assimilation.  

'''CANARI:'''

 * Katya has a few CANARI updates which can possibly be ready for a cy43h2.1 release. Katya should coordinate any updates and time for submission with Daniel.

=== ECOCLIMAP Second Generation ===

ECOSG gives some good results, especially for the Iberia domain. In general a good increase of maximum daytime T2m (exceptions are Ireland). However, the main problem, probably created by a lower LAI  for the open-land patch, is an increase in U10m which creates a considerable positive bias over many sub-domains (Iberia outside forested regions, the Netherlands, Ireland, …). The idea to tackle this is by a tuning of the roughness length formulations for grass and C3 crops:

 * z0_grass = 0.13 * LAI / 6 → 0.13 * LAI / 3
 * z0_C3crops = 0.13 * min( 1.0, zallen )  where zallen = exp( (LAI-3.5)/1.3 )  → exp( (LAI-2.5?)/1.3 )

[[Image(roughness_length.png, 40%)]]

* A bit worrying aspect is that the alternatives LAI_300m (2014-2016) and LAI_1km (1999-2016) as input for LAI to the PGD step shows quite different behaviour. For the tg1 experiments we have used LAI_300m. See here: [https://hirlam.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201911/BP_ECO-SG_Surface-201911.pdf PDF]

* A test of the suggested tuning for z0_C3crops (reducing the 3.5 value slightly more than the value proposed above) has been done over the AEMET domain. [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201911/Z0_crops_tg1_tunning.pdf Report ] [ https://hirlam.org/portal/aemet/verif43tg1_tg2/newcrop_z0h_check/ Monitor Results]  

'''Should we go for tg1 or tg2 in the next release of cy43h2.1?'''

The main ambitions at the surface working week are directed towarads tg1 (incluing ECOSG) but HIRLAM Managemenet Group needs to weight different aspects in a decision on which target to go for in a release of cy43h2.1 so we don't have the final decision yet...

=== Physiography discussion ===

See agenda for the physiography discussion under the Monday items. The main outcome of the discussion includes:

Participants: Apart from the the working group participants also Maragarta Choulga (ECMMWF) and Ekaterina Kourzeneva (FMI) participated via web link.

 * Bolli has created [wiki:PGD a wiki page where we can document and link to all kind of physiography related information, data and tools].
 * We decided to [wiki:PGD/Regional_Data_Sets document which regional physiography data is used for different domains. See wiki page for that here.]
 * Margarita informs us that ECOSG has been partly modified compared to the original ESA-CCI data. E.g., related to some water bodies.
 * Margarita informs us that Copernicus has more detaild (more precise) physiogray data avaulbale for the European region which may be useful to consider for LAM models like ours. E.g. urban data.
 * Bolli has cretaed a soil depth data file based on the hard coded soil depth numbrs for ECOSG in 
 * We decide that HIRLAM as organisation will not take responsibility to create global data sets complemented with local/regional data sets. One of the main reasons for this is that it becomes difficult to creare smooth transitions between reginal and global data along borders.
 * For use of regional physiography data HIRLAM partners are advicded to use the functionality provided by SURFEX/PGD to read in such data in e.g. ASCII format. [wiki:/Surface_physis_assimilation/pgd_ecoclimap_work#ReplaceadefaultECOCLIMAPphysiographyfieldwithexternaldatainthiscasetreeheight See e.g. how the MetCoOp tree data is used.]   
 * Geoffrey has documented [https://github.com/gbessardon/National-soil-data how gdal and python can be used to merge a regional data set (shape file format) into a ECOCLIMAP/ PGD global binary file].
