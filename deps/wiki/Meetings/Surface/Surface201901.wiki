WW switched to SMHI at the end of February 2019.

== Working items and comments ==

'''Please add items'''

 * Next meteorological release of cy43h2.1 can maybe be expected in autumn 2019. Here we plan to still keep Force-restore and D95 snow but look into some updates related to ([wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/First_cy43h_setup see details here]):
   * ECOCLIMAP-SG, Second Generation
   * ECUME scheme for the water fraction of the sea tile
   * Modified increments of soil moisture in the OI assimilation scheme
   * Orography - turbulence (OROTUR)
   * Modified values of minimum stomatal resistance Rsmin
   * Assimilation of satellite product of snow extent
   * New clay and sand database
   * Remove surface assimilation in the TEB tile
   * Implement satellite albedo climatologies for glaciers
   * Consider to replace ECMWF SST analysis with OSISAF data

 * Issues related to horizontal spacialization of the surface observations (CANARI)
   * Harmonization of physiography between CANARI and SURFEX.
   * Tiling in CANARI. How to proceed? The better theoretical basis is needed. Experience from span may be used.
   * Elaboration of observation operators.
   * Providing the consistency in diagnostic calculations between SURFEX and CANARI.
   * Cleaning of CANARI? 

 * Next big step will be to introduce new land-surface physics (diffusion soil, explicit snow, Multi-Energy Balance) in combination with SEKF assimilation. Maybe this can become operational in 2020... What to do:
   * cy43h_alpha is now running in climate mode utilizing all [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/New_SURFEX_options_cy43h options in our new surface wish list] except MEB. Samuel and Emily are active here and now also Rossby Centre (SMHI) colleagues are involved in sea/ice handling. [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201901/Viana_cy43h_climate_tests.pdf]
   * Åsmund is running cy43h_alpha in NWP mode where he has activated diffusion soil + explicit snow in combination with SEKF. Here there are quite a few questions to consider related to e.g.
     * Which control variables to include
     * Estimation of model errors
     * How to treat the forest patch (apply smaller increments from the surface analysis or give a larger observation error of T2m and Rh2m).
     * Maybe we should run a soil analysis entirely offline (see also idea by Balázs)

 * The longer term plan involves replacing SEKF with EnKF step wise in 1D, 2D, 3D
   * Development and tests are ongoing by the SURFEX team and Tomas Landelius (SMHI). 

 * Balázs Szintai wishes to discuss / work on
   * test of FLake in cy40t1 (using Surfex 7.3) over Hungarian domain
   * Surfex offline runs in connection with vegetation

'''Discussion points'''

 * Now we can run with SOIL_TEXTURE_VERSION=SOILGRID. Over !MetCoOp domain SOILGRID gives minor impact so there it seems to be safe to activate ([https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201901/Sand_Clay_report.pdf see very brief validation report here]). However, Samuel's experience with SOILGRID over the Iberia domain is less positive[https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201901/soilgrids_vs_fao_report_AEMET.pdf Report]. We look into this together...

== Memory notes ==

=== Short term plans  ===

The short term plans are related to development for a meteorological release of cy43h2.1.
The surface will be represented by Force-restore and D95 snow and details of...

'''[wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/First_cy43h_setup suggested surface components for cy43h2.1 are listed in this wiki]'''.

'''The wiki now includes actions to be taken in the next few months and lists expected people to be involved.'''

The list of components currently includes:

 *   ECOCLIMAP-SG, Second Generation
 *   CANARI issues
 *   ECUME scheme for the water fraction of the sea tile
 *   Modified increments of soil moisture in the OI assimilation scheme
 *   Orography - turbulence (OROTUR)
 *   Modified values of minimum stomatal resistance Rsmin
 *   Assimilation of satellite product of snow extent
 *   New clay and sand database
 *   Remove surface assimilation in the TEB tile
 *   Test of soil-ice bug reported by Météo-France
 *   Test of modified XRIMAX
 *   Implement satellite albedo climatologies for glaciers
 *   Consider to replace ECMWF SST analysis with OSISAF data

In addition a few earlier optional settings in cy40h1.1.1 will now be default:

 * FLAKE
 * SICE
 * 2-patches
 * RCT2SY=10. (setting in CANARI to allow larger observation deviation). But this setting may depend on final value of XRIMAX... 
 * XZ0SN => '0.003', XZ0HSN => '0.0003'  (modified snow roughness)

The final list that enters cy43h2.1 will depend on outcome of tests and when the cycle is planned to be released. 


=== Medium term plans  ===

The medium term plans include replacing of Force-restore + D95 with diffusion soil, explicit snow and Multi-Energy Balance in combination with (S)EKF surface assimilation. We run the system in climate mode using our [wiki:Surface_physis_assimilation/New_SURFEX_options_cy43h SURFEX wish list] to identify/reduce biases.
After that stepwise inclusion of satellite products can start (soil moisture, sea-ice temperature, transpiation …). The medium term plans also include consideration of TITAN/gridPP as an alternative to CANARI. Other development include ES scheme as glacier model, sea wave-atmosphere coupling, SICE development, ORORAD, physiography validation/development, prognostic LAI.

 * The SURFEX wish list is under testing in climate mode in cy43h by Samuel and Emily [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201901/Viana_cy43h_climate_tests.pdf Samuel] and [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201901/Harmonie_Surface_EGleeson_Feb2019.pdf Emily] (see their presentataions). A how-to-progress discussion, including issues, was held together with Rossby Centre representatives. Samuel has summarized the outcome of this discussion on the  [wiki:HarmonieClimate/HCLIM43?version=17#DraftplansfortestingHCLIM43discussedinsidemeetingwithRossbyCentrecolleaguesduringlastSFCworkingweekinNorrk%C3%B6ppingFebruary282019 HARMONIE Climate cy43 wiki page].

 * The development and investigation of the performence of SEKF in the cy43h environment is currently lead by [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201901/Surface%20Analysis%20with%20EKF%20ISBA-DIF.pdf Åsmund]. Here TITAN/gridPP is used for the surface analysis.
   * Åsmund's experience is that we can identify suitable soil levels for control variables by studing the size of Jacobians as a function of level for e.g. dT2m/dTG, dRh2m/dWG. Selected levels will be different for each patch since root depth is different.
   * One question is which analysis increment to apply over the forest patch since the (SYNOP) increment is truly only representataive for the open-land patch. Here we can lend upon analysis method of Tomas where he has quantified the correlataion between patches and soil levels. Alternatively, if we see a problem with drifting forest soil column we may apply nuding towards the open-land soil column.  
   * In this development a very useful offline surface environment has been developed by Trygve and Åsmund within cy43h. For example, it includes the possibility to setup SURFEX offline with forcing prepared based upon an earlier 3D HARMONIE-AROME simulation.
   * The foring preparation is based upon Python script which is not yeat part of the cy43h environment.


=== Long term plans  ===

The long term plans include:
 * Replace 1D vertical EKF with 1D EnKF.
 * Replace OI analysis & 1D DA with 3D EnKF and products with radiances.
 * Coupled DA for atmosphere and surface based on 4D EnKF.

The steps toward the long term plan are nicely visualized by Tomas in this slide.

=== Lake and sea treatment ===

[https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Meetings/Surface/Surface201901/Rontu_lakesea.pdf Laura presented] how we currently deal with lake and sea settings. One interesting question is how we should treat big lakes. Should they be handled by FLake or is 3D circulation important enough which would motivate the use of a 3D ocean model for such lakes. We have the possibility to evaluate this using experiments done over the !MetCoOp domain. In the operational setting, for the two biggest lakes in Sweden, Vänern and Vättern, the LST (lake surface temperature) and LIC (lake-ice concentration) is provided by the NEMO model which is applied operationally by SMHI. And we also have test simulations where these lakes were handeled by FLake. Laura is leading an investigation to evaluate the performance.
