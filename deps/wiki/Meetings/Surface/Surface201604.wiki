== Purpose and working items ==

One of the most important aspects of HARMONIE we should develop further within the next few years is more advanced surface data assimilation methods.
This meeting will focus on development of assimilation methods, primarily EKF, in SURFEX with focus on processes related to snow/land, ice and lakes.
The meeting is planned April 11-14, Monday-Thursday, but main presentations and discussions will take place Tuesday-Wednesday. So please try to attend
at least those two days. Besides presentations and discussions we will work as well :-)

 * In Metcoop we currently work on implementing the use of two patches over land instead of only one. The reason why we try this is because we believe we sometimes have problems with excess evaporation in our AROME simulations. Such excess evaporation could be caused by too large roughness length due to land average of roughness for one patch only. Using two patches require modifications of CANARI/OI and decisions on how increments should be distributed between the two patches (similar problem as in HIRLAM newsnow). This work is ongoing. We report progress... (Patrick)
 * Surface physics based on SURFEXv8 (ISBAv8) is now available in a cy40h branch (https://svn.hirlam.org/branches/harmonie-40h1_ISBASFX8). The purpose of this branch is to give opportunity to develop HARMONIE utilizing the Explicit Snow Scheme (CSNOW="3-L") and diffusion soil scheme (CISBA="DIF"). The initialisation of the 3-L snow prognostic variables in PREP needs consideration. This part has not been compared with the corresponding SURFEX8 subroutines. Current implementation works technically but not necessarily how it should. For technical reasons the number of soil layers for DIF is hard coded to 14 layers. Just a few layers beneath the surface the time scale of change is far beyond the NWP forecast time scale. Thus, how do we identify the relevant prognostic variables to include in the assimilation and which ones to leave for peaceful coexistence? (Patrick) The SURFEX part of the branch harmonie-40h1_ISBASFX8 is also available as an offline setup of SURFEX. This setup is available here https://svn.hirlam.org/branches/SURFEXcy40h_with_ISBAv8 .
 * Assimilation of sea-ice temperature. Now when we have Yurii's sea-ice scheme running we can also deal with assimilation of sea-ice temperature. How to proceed?
 * Improved representation of glaciers: Currently glaciers are described as permanent snow in the Ecoclimap database. However, in the Harmonie model they do not have the physical properties of actual snow surfaces, especially with regard to radiation and heat fluxes. This leads to systematic errors in a number of variables, including surface ground and air temperatures. We will introduce and evaluate more realistic simulations over permanent snow surfaces.
