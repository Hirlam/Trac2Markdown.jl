'''Getting there:'''

From Vilnius airport:

Option 1: 

Take a taxi from Vilnius Airport. The only possible for late-time arrivals, unless you use Option 3. 
More information about airport taxi fares http://www.vilnius-airport.lt/en/planning-a-trip/how-to-reach/taxi. It should cost you around 14 EUR during daytime, might be double during the night.
You might save some money if ordering a taxi (ordering a taxi is typically ~ 40%-50% cheaper) (should pick you up in front of the Departure hall, so you will have to go there)
It is recommended to call "Smart Taxi" (short no. 1820 or +370 520 00 820) in case you decide to do so.

Option 2:

Take a bus no. 3G from the airport. 
Tickets must be purchased from the driver (single ticket valid for one single ride costs 1 EUR). 
Get off the bus  on the 7th stop, called "Zaliasis Tiltas", which is right after the bus crosses a bridge over a river (the only one possible). 
Then wait for a bus nr. 6G, and go 2 stops further, or take a trolley nr. 14 and go 3 stops further.  Get off the bus at the bus stop "Seimyniskiu" (right before a transport roundabout) and walk some 20 meters back. The hotel is located on your left if walking from there, you should also see a separate "Hotel Sarunas" sign near the street (this is where Raitininku street begins). Turn left. The hotel is situated behind a red building that you should see first from the street.

Option 3:

Order transfer from the airport to the hotel by including an additional request when placing a hotel order:

"transfer from/ to airport" and your arrival details. Price is 20 EUR per single ride, up to 3 people can use the same car.

Option 4:

Call Martynas +37068302535 in case you need any help.
