= Objectives =

The ultimate goal of this work is to make comparisons and improvements of the radiation schemes available in HARMONIE, i.e. the IFS, ACRANEB and HLRADIA. AROME physics has been chosen for the platform where all radiation routines can be compared in a clean way. Thus, calls of all three radiation routines are being implemented in apl_arome.F90 (or apl_par.F90?), with common interfaces between radiation and clouds, aerosol and surface. In this framework, a clean comparison of any further developments inside the three radiation schemes is also possible. It is important to allow the radiation routines to concentrate on radiation and prepare the common input concerning cloud, aerosol and surface state before entering the radiation calculations.

>Experiments over Europe accounting for the direct radiative effect of aerosols based on 3 different aerosol data sources have been performed for April 2011, utilized data sets are: 1) Default climatology (Tegen et al. 1997) 2) (MACv1) (Kinne et al., 2013) 3) time varying data from MACC reanalysis (Inness et al., 2013). Simulation of SW radiation and temperature and humidity in the lower troposphere is considerably improved in aerosol containing experiments compared to experiment without aerosols. Although differences between aerosol containing experiments are rather small during situation with near average aerosol distribution, using real time aerosol data can lead to considerable improvement in the accuracy of NWP forecast during situations with high aerosol amounts (like summer 2010 Russian wildfires) and should be further investigated.

> Current status and future plans
>
>  - The '''''Morcrette radiation scheme''''', which is currently used in AROME, has not been (and is not being) developed since 2006 at ECMWF. Thus, it is not a good long-term strategy to keep developing and using this scheme.
>  - The current IFS radiation scheme '''''Mc Rad''''' with its smoothened global irradiance field (both spatially, temporally and statistically) does not appear suitable for high resolution NWP modelling of strong precipitation events ([http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/aladin/IMG/pdf/talk_rb_alaro1.pdf Brozkova et al., ALADIN-HIRLAM ASM 2015]). 
>  - The '''''hlradia scheme''''' in AROME is an option to use in ensemble runs in the near term. Otherwise, this is not a scheme for the future.
>  - '''''ACRANEB2''''' is now used operationally in the ALARO1 NWP model in several countries. This can also be run in the AROME framework both in ensembles and in deterministic models (DMI might run ALARO1 for Greenland from 2016).
>  - The gas optics part of the UKMO '''''SOCRATES radiation scheme''''' is suggested by Robin as a good option for faster computations that do not need the very high accuracy in gas atmospheric heating rates that can be simulated with the Mc Rad scheme.
>  - Robin has made a beta-version of the '''''SPARTACUS radiation scheme'''''. This includes the 3D cloud radiative effects shown in his presentation. The radiation scheme is also designed in a modular way that makes it flexible for updates. In the long term this looks like a good option.

'''''Initial states'''''

Picking profiles + surface information from 3D AROME experiments. Interesting cases suggested by the cloud team? Sodankylä spring 2014? CLOUDNET data, Hyytiälä cases? To discuss with the cloud team.

Find the optimal way how to use and modify them, including the surface initial state (lfi). Ensure that different cloud/precipitation species get correctly read in by the MUSC experiment. Keerping the initial cloud state without time evolution in microphysics (LMICRO=.false. - is this sufficient?).

'''''Code modifications'''''

Modifying the cloud SW and LW optical properties by considering the different existing parametrizations inside IFS radiation: Modifying size - effective/equivalent radia, modifying shape - available spherical/hexagonal.  Modifying asymmetry factor, SSA directly.  ACRANEB2, hlradia for comparison even if modification of the cloud optical properties in them is more limited. 

>       - Plan for LW intercomparison of 3 radiation schemes in HARMONIE-AROME

'''''Initial states'''''

Artificial clear sky, cloud condensate and aerosol loads - using the data of 2014 Nielsen et al paper?

'''''Code'''''

harmonie-40h1.radiation with the three schemes IFS, ACRANEB2, hlradia using the default schemes.
Reference: DISORT with HITRAN. Modifying cloud and aerosol optical properties in LW to see sensitivies.

>       - adding CLOUDNET verification to the Gleeson et al. 2015 Newsletter comparison for 2013

* Cloud overlap variable (IFS, ACRANEB2) consistency with cloud schemes. NOVLP variable settings.


=== Effective radia for liquid clouds === 

Jason wrote the 1st of September: "The experiments are still progressing. Ensembles are necessary in the 3D Harmonie runs in order to prove that there is a statistically robust response to the surface temperature via the influence of the effective radii passed through to the radiation scheme. We choose June 2012 for our experiments starting on the 10th as dictated by the boundary conditions which are currently available. Other meteo variables didn't change so much over a short run of a few days.

There is already a 'choice' of using the menon parameterization with the tegen climatology but into HARMONIEcy38.1. Therefore we test switching from the Martin parameterization to the Menon parameterization using the TEGEN climatology for the aerosol mass as a first order sensitivity test (where we already picked up on the perturbation in the temperature response).

Validation of the ensemble result is necessary in order to say anything about improvements, which still has to be done. Disturbing initial states to differentiate effects from noise with the aim of determining whether the predictability actually increases once compared with observations. C-IFS data is the 6hrly 1 x 1 fields for the soluble fraction (SO4=,OM,Sea-salt) needed to calculate the cloud droplet number concentration with pre-processing performed as we discussed in Denmark in April."

 
=== HARMONIE radiation branch cy40, towards convergence in cy43t phasing? ===

What could go in?

* Three radiation schemes with aerosol: IFS, ACRANEB2 (already in cy40h1.beta.x), add HLRADIA [ both to apl_arome.F90 and aplpar.F90 ]

* Ororad = parametrization of the slope, shadow and sky view effects on solar and thermal radiation into apl_arome and aplpar when using SURFEX. Ororad will enter finally from SURFEX v.8

* Minor rearrangement of input-output-transfer of variables in apl_arome (aplpar?) related to radiation in connection with ororad usage

* Minor changes in IFS radiation: SUAERV - rounding errors .... see musc 38 expt - check if any other minor edits are missing?

* HLRADIA and ACRANEB2 1 or 6 bands in definitions (NSW/NSWB_MNH) - which should we use? At apl_arome level, these indicate # bands for SURFEX and albedo only.

* NRADFR needs to be 1 for HLRADIA - investigate whether it can be changed?

* Check usage of LRADFLEX for HLRADIA? (for ACRANEB2 it's T). 

* Some cleaning of indexes  (JSG, JJ, JL) and misleading comments related to them in apl_arome (check aplpar?). KSGT=NTSSG and JSG have nothing to do with radiation!

=== Radiation Namelists ===
- At the HARMONIE Climate training course, there were many requests for documentation on namelists. I've starting making one for radiation which can be edited: [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/Radiation201511/RadiationNamelists.odt RadNamelists] 

=== Benchmarking various clear sky models ===

Clear sky model benchmarking in the framework of IEA SHC Task 46: "Solar Resource Assessment and Forecasting."

delta-Eddington vs. Ritter-Geleyn 1992

Notes from Jan:
If one wanted to evaluate the impact of delta-two stream formulation on surface global radiation for Toravere case, it should not be a problem to switch from Ritter-Geleyn 1992 to delta-Eddington in ACRANEB2 (by modifying few lines of the code). One could also use the path lengthening factor of Rodgers in order to mimick FMR scheme. It is of course too late for EUMETCHEM paper, but still might be interesting for us.

I would also like to discuss the problem of direct solar flux 
(delta-scaled versus unscaled) and its usage in bottom boundary 
condition, verification, energy applications and so on, in order to find 
the best strategy how to handle it in the code.

Notes from Kristian:

A specific test/comparison of high solar zenith angle parametrizations can be made against the libRadtran/sdisort model of Mayer et al./Dahlback et al..

The method of interpolating between radiation time steps can be improved by using clear sky bottom of atmosphere SZAs rather than top of atmosphere SZAs (e.g. Blanc et al. 2015: http://r.duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fmeetingorganizer.copernicus.org%2FEMS2015%2FEMS2015-318.pdf)

== Radiation observations for model validation ==

How to advance in making surface-based (downwelling SW and LW) radiation observations from (SYNOP) stations regularly available for NWP validation? How to demonstrate the usefulness of these observations, where to make an initiative? WMO, EUCOS? 

From where to get/request radiation observations for verification of research experiments over Europe. 
E.g. Emily has used observations from Ireland, BSRN measurements were used for aerosol study.
Are radiation measurements from stations in different countries in Europe available from somewhere (for case studies)?


=== HIRLAM - ALADIN aerosol planning ===

[https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/Radiation201511/bentaerosol-mails.tgz Bent's initiative and discussion during summer 2015]

How should the experiments with different treatment of aerosols (different aerosol input data sets, different radiation schemes) be continued to evaluate the impact of treatment of aerosols on the accuracy of forecast of GHI and DNI.    
DNI in model output + observations needed 

=== Updating aerosol climatology ===

ECMWF is updating aerosol climatology in IFS to MACC-reanalysis climatology (instead of Tegen climatology) for calculating the direct radiative effect of aerosols. 
This climatology should be available early 2016 (Alessio Bozzo is working with this in ECMWF)  

Updating to MACC-reanalysis climatology in HARMONIE (Velle, in contact with Alessio and HIRLAM system people)
- this gives more up-to-date aerosol optical properties
(although influence over Europe is not expected to be strong)
- first step towards using real time aerosol data from C-IFS forecast
- usage of the climatology can also be imported from IFS code to the extent as it is possible 
(first thing is to see how this update is done in IFS)
- comparison of MACC-reanalysis climatology to other available data (e.g. MACv1 climatology)

== Parametrization of cloud ice / liquid optical properties ==

We get poor results in MUSC when PCLFR=1 and RADSN/GR are non-zero. One reason for this could be that the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of snow and graupel are not used explicitly.

Treating precipitation species as cloud cover should be OK provided that the IOPs are correct. With RADGR and RADSN the mass extinction coefficient can be adjusted relative to the mass extinction of cloud ice uniformly for all spectral bands. In addtion to this there is a need for SW spectral band SSAs and gs for graupel and snow. These can then be added as terms in the the weighted averages of SSA and g, that is:

707 	!  - MIX of WATER and ICE CLOUDS

708 	        ZTAUMX= ZTOL + ZTOI + ZTOR

709 	        ZOMGMX= ZTOL*ZOL + ZTOI*ZOI + ZTOR*ZOR

710 	        ZASYMX= ZTOL*ZOL*ZGL + ZTOI*ZOI*ZGI + ZTOR*ZOR*ZGR

711 	

712 	        ZASYMX= ZASYMX/ZOMGMX

713 	        ZOMGMX= ZOMGMX/ZTAUMX

Rather than using RADSN and RADGR it would be more correct to have explicit ZTOG, ZTOS, ... terms here for snow and graupel, respectively.

For the LW, there is no single scattering albedos and asymmetry factors in the Morcrette scheme. Thus, only the 16 LW spectral bands of ZTAUCLD are affected. Here in particular, it should make a difference if RADSN and RADGR are not uniform across the SW and LW spectra.

Petri Räisänen's recent publication: "[http://www.the-cryosphere.net/9/1277/2015/tc-9-1277-2015.pdf Parameterization of single-scattering properties of snow]" can be used for snow but not graupel. The data are based on a field study of direct measurements of the volume scattering function of blowing snow near the surface. Concretely, this can first be adopted to spectral bands that we use and then compared to the Fu et al. (1996) to check whether there are significant differences. If so, this parametrization should be used. See Petri's presentation for more details.

Petri remarked that a general, and likely more important, issue with snow is that currently the snow effective size is calculated with the Sun & Rikus parametrization as a function of the local ice water concentration and temperature in a given grid box. Thus, when the snow falls beneath the cloud the snow effective size with vary with the local conditions in an unrealistic manner. '''Perhaps the most correct way to solve this issue would be to fix the snow effective size below the cloud to the effective size at the base of this.''' In general, the size calculation should not be done locally in the radiation scheme.

Work to be started 2016 by Kristian in connection with Petri. Sensitivity experiments with cloud/precipitating particles as formulated presently can be done any time with MUSC.
