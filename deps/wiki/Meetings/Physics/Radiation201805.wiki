= Objectives =

The ultimate goal of this work is to make comparisons and improvements of the radiation schemes available in HARMONIE, i.e. the IFS, ACRANEB and HLRADIA. AROME physics has been chosen for the platform where all radiation routines can be compared in a clean way. Thus, calls of all three radiation routines are being implemented in apl_arome.F90 (or aplpar.F90?), with common interfaces between radiation and clouds, aerosol and surface. In this framework, a clean comparison of any further developments inside the three radiation schemes is also possible. It is important to allow the radiation routines to concentrate on radiation and prepare the common input concerning cloud, aerosol and surface state before entering the radiation calculations.

Status of radiation in HIRLAM Rolling Work Plan http://hirlam.org/index.php/rolling-plan- do we suggest modifications based on the ECMWF radiation workshop https://www.ecmwf.int/en/learning/workshops/workshop-radiation-next-generation-weather-forecast-models ? 

Additional topics: 

 * Problems of observed v.s. simulated direct radiation (Petri)

The measurements of direct solar radiation by pyrheliometers typically cover
a half-opening angle of 2-3 degrees around the Sun. Therefore, they can be
"contaminated" by a substantial amount of near-forward scattered radiation,
especially in the presence of ice clouds. Thus, direct solar radiation
computed using the standard Beer's law underestimates the "apparent"
(i.e. measured) direct radiation.
Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations show that, to a good
approximation, the apparent direct solar radiation may still be computed
using Beer's law, provided that the actual cloud or aerosol optical depth
is replaced by a scaled optical depth (i.e., by excluding the
part of the phase function at scattering angles smaller than the
instrument half-opening angle).
