== Notes from the meeting ==

Lisa Bengtsson: Using Sibbo's cloud DA scheme from HIRLAM may be a problem,
since AROME uses a statistical cloud scheme that is quite different from the
Rasch-Kristjansson scheme in HIRLAM. This could cause overestimation of the
cloud cover.

-o-

Laura Rontu: How to use the global radiation station observations (shown in Erik's presentation) in Finland be used for NWP validation?

Anders Lindfors: The data are available on a minute-by-minute basis.
Some stations are cleaned regularly, others are not; they are thus gruped
into first class and second class stations. The main stations data are
available from at least the last 15 years.

-o-

Mikhail Sofiev: The Menon et al. scheme for cloud droplet number concentration
is not the best to use.

Mikhail Sofiev responding to the question on the aerosol data available from SILAM, both from operational forecast and re-analysis 1980-2015: the data include concentrations and AOD at 385/550/1020nm, hourly, with all main aerosol components and size classes for global, European, Asian, and Northern-European domains (see e.g. http://silam.fmi.fi/thredds/catalog.html for the forecasts description and download).

-o-

Kristian Pagh Nielsen: We should consider using the new ECRAD radiation
scheme.

Eric Bazile: Intercomparisons are needed before we choose to change the
radiation scheme.

Karl Ivar Ivarsson: Currently, I work on the current IFS (cy25) radiation
scheme. Should I stop doing so if this is to be substituted?

Kristian Pagh Nielsen: Optimally, the radiation schemes need only optical
properties of gases, clouds and aerosols. Alternatively, cloud liquid and
ice water concentrations, together with the cloud droplet number concentration

-o-

Laura Rontu: We should externalise the cloud-precipitation microphysics computations (particle size) from the
radiation scheme.

Francois Bouyssel: Climatological log-normal size distributions of aerosols
are used as input to the LIMA scheme.

-o-

Lisa Bengtsson: The new MUSC that we (Eric, Wim, Lisa, ...) have been
developing during the last two years should be put in a common repository.
ALARO should also be included in such a test bed.

Daan de Grauwe: I agree, however, we need to aim for a common cycle.

Laura Rontu: Can you forecast if this should cy43 or cy44?

Daan de Grauwe: No.

Eric Bazile: MUSC should be the same version as the current operational system.

Laura Rontu: We (Karl Ivar, Laura, Emily, ...) have just managed to compile and build a MUSC test experiment of cy43t2. 
MUSC input for atmospheric part was picked from older 3D HARMONIE experiment, for PGD from a full 43t2-experiment.

Eric Bazile: The new version of MUSC is already in Mitraillette. Here the new
MUSC version includes correct forcing during the run, while the previous
version only runs from an initial value.

Lisa Bengtsson: Who would do the work with implementing this in the HIRLAM
repository?

Eric Bazile: 70% of our problems come from SURFEX. The SURFEX people do 1D
tests with 1D Meso-NH, uses a 16 point grid, rather than the 4 point grid that
is used in MUSC.

Laura Rontu: There are two ways to prepare MUSC input: pick by gl from the 3D model (and edit the atmospheric profile if needed), or generate by ACADFA, PGD, PREP from namelist input. The latter way should be build also for cy43, not yet done.

Eric Bazile: A MUSC user community could be made.

Jeanette Onvlee: This needs to be decided at a management level.

-o-

Eric Bazile: If OOPS will go deep into the dynamical parts of our code, this
could be a huge issue.

-o-

Laura & Lisa: We should rather wait for when we are to phase the LIMA scheme
into the model than to implement too overly complex aerosol aspects into the
current microphysics scheme.

-o-

Victoria & Francois Bouyssel: In other to input MOGACE data to our current
research version of AROME, we now use a Python script for the interpolation.
This needs to be changed for operational purposes.

Francois Bouyssel: Now we also just provide the initial aerosol condition,
which is then used throughout the forecast.

Laura Rontu: Do we know if we can get ready made optical properties from
CAMS in near real time? Are the aerosol concentrations aa sufficient input for the cloud-precipitation microphysics?

Francois Bouyssel: Yes, for the time being the concentrations are the only
thing that we need for the precipitation microphysics.

-o-

Eric Bazile: In UERRA we found systematical SW surface downward biases of
more than +20 W/m^^2. Have anyone else found similar values?

-o-

Emily Gleeson: I've added some preliminary Tegen vs CAMS results for the Irish domain: [https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/CAR2017/TEGENvCAMSplots.pdf Tegen vs CAMS Ireland]
- regarding comparing output from any runs to radiation measurements, it would also be very useful to use sites that have relevant cloud data also (cloud profiles etc).
