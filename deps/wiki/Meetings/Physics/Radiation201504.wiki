= Objectives =

The ultimate goal of this work is to make comparisons and improvements of the radiation schemes available in HARMONIE, i.e. the IFS, ACRANEB and HLRADIA. AROME physics has been chosen for the platform where all radiation routines can be compared in a clean way. Thus, calls of all three radiation routines are being implemented in apl_arome.F90 (or apl_par.F90?), with common interfaces between radiation and clouds, aerosol and surface. In this framework, a clean comparison of any further developments inside the three radiation schemes is also possible. It is important to allow the radiation routines to concentrate on radiation and prepare the common input concerning cloud, aerosol and surface state before entering the radiation calculations.

== Aerosols ==


=== Aerosol direct and semi-direct effects in hlradia ===

=== Plans for the next HARMONIE experiments ===

How to test the influence of the aerosol vertical distribution in the radiation parametrizations? The effect has been shown to be important in case studies. Presently, in HARMONIE the vertically integrated AOD is distributed vertically using assumed profiles for 6 aerosol types. Can reliable observations of aerosol profiles, together with radiation observations be obtained for validation and sensitivity experiments? 

=== Aerosol optical properties and their dependence on relative humidity ===

For the IFS sheme aerosol SW properties are defined in  
https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/branches/harmonie-38h1.radiation/src/arp/phys_radi/suaersn.F90
and aerosol LW properties are defined in
https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/branches/harmonie-38h1.radiation/src/arp/phys_radi/suaerl.F90

Should some of the IFS aerosol SW properties be updated for specific aerosol types? Are the aerosol types optimally defined in HARMONIE-AROME? What is the sensitivity of the radiation fluxes to these definitions?

There is potential problem with LW properties, with the IFS LW scaling factor values (to calculate AOD at LW spectral intervals) disagreeing with an order of magnitude (too low) relative to the Koepke et al. (1997)/Hess et al. (1998)?

=== Aerosol indirect effects in HARMONIE ===

Information on aerosol effects in IFS model can be found in ECMWF technical memorandum 660
Aerosol-Cloud-Radiation Interactions and their Impact on ECMWF/MACC Forecasts: http://old.ecmwf.int/publications/library/ecpublications/_pdf/tm/601-700/tm660.pdf

=== How to implement aerosol indirect effects in HARMONIE ===

In the IFS cy40r radiation scheme the indirect aerosol effects are currently calculated from a CCN value that again is estimated from the aerosol types: Sulphate, organic matter and sea salt. Since these aerosol types are available from C-IFS, we can use this calculation to derive CCNs offline from the C-IFS product and then be input to the HARMONIE IFS radiation scheme (.../phys_ec/radlsw.F90). The calculation is the same as the one in Jason's presentation.

Currently .../phys_ec/radlsw.F90 has the input arrays PCCNL and PCCNO that contain CCNs for land and sea, respectively. They are currently unused and only have the dimension KLON, i.e. they are not specified per level. These arrays need to be replaced by arrays with the dimensions KLON,KLEV. Otherwise, nothing needs to be changed in .../phys_ec/radlsw.F90. The reason for having separate CCNs for land and sea comes from Martin (1994), who uses different calculations of cloud liquid effective radii from CCNs for land and sea.

== Friday 9:00 - 17:00 ==


== General radiation work ==

=== Implementation and test of cloud optical improvements in cy38h1.2/cy40h ===

=== Optimization of Karl-Ivar's OCND2 cloud ice updates for radiation ===

From the radiation point of view, the problem of OCND2 updates is that the cloud ice (non-precipitating crystals) are mostly gone: their integrated content has decreased with an order of magnitude and correspondingly the amount of cloud liquid has increased, now being an order of magnitude larger than that of ice crystals. In precipitating (winter) cases, the cloud ice has partly converted to precipitating large snow and graupel particles. The coefficients RADSN and RADGR were suggested to add part of snow and graupel to the ice crystal content entering the radiation schemes. Correspondingly, virtual cloud cover was created based on the modified ice content. From the radiation point of view there are several relevant questions:

1) Non-precipitating (small) crystals are assumed in radiation parametrizations to be hexagonal and described by the cloud ice content and an effective radius. The optical properties of precipiting snow and graupel are different, how to find information about them to suggest improved parametrizations? Can we learn something based on the spectral optical properties of fresh snow laying on ground, which is a topic of wide interest, with a lot of measurement data available? 

2) How sensitive the present radiation parametrizations are to the definition of the cloud ice particle size and shape definitions? How large errors does the suggested combination of all ice to the category of non-precipitating crystal introduce? This can be studied with MUSC sensitivity experiments by including precipitating snow and graupel into the initial state for radiation. Experiments would show how important in practice for the weather and radiation forecast is the correct treatment of cloud ice - perhaps the schemes are not at all sensitive to these definitions? By using Sodankylä radiation and SYNOP observations, hints of the realism of the effects could be obtained.

3) There are earlier suggestions by Hannu Savijärvi (reference to an old paper in QJRMS to be found), included in the IFS radiation code, to take into account falling water droplets. Should be easy to bring these modifications back and test in MUSC, possibly to get hints for treatment of falling frozen particle optical properties.
 

=== Testing within 3D HARMONIE ===

=== Direct/diffuse irradiance split verifications ===
 
The data is available e.g. from BSRN stations. Potential problem with different angular treatment between
observations and simulation: for Tõravere 08.08.2010 comparison, instrument angle for direct radiation observations was 10 degrees, leading to much higher direct flux compared to simulations: https://hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/Radiation201504/Toravere_fluxes.png 

At the fminwp web site direct, diffuse and newly introduced DNI from HIRLAM and FMI HARMONIE-AROME is compared regularly with Sodankylä measurements: http://fminwp.fmi.fi/mastverifnew/



=== Radiation coupling to SURFEX ===

Wim's problem of different instant radiation output in SURFEX and AROME and its solution at hirlam.org Forum: http://hirlam.org/index.php/forum/2-harmonie-system/1175-different-radiation-in-physics-and-surfex

Albedo definitions between (IFS) radiation and SURFEX were corrected: what was the impact of the change done between 38h1.1 and 38h1.2? For further study: the adventures of albedo in the AROME-SURFEX code: is everything well with data transfer, usage, output? 

The ororad developments are implemented in SURFEX coupling_surf_atm so that they are available for apl_arome, aplpar, OFFLINE calling SURFEX with minor changes in the interface. The input are the the downwelling solar and terrestrial fluxes. SURFEX provides surface-depedent grid-scale (spectral) albedo and emissivity for the atmospheric radiation schemes. Output net fluxes are recalculated after SURFEX with ororad. Orografic radiation does not presently provide direct feedback to atmospheric radiation, this could be done by modifying the albedo with orographic effects. 

=== Which radiation variables should be output from cy40h? ===

The same as in cy38h are sufficient?

=== LW comparisons without and with aerosol ===

    - Possible issue in IFS LW??? https://www.hirlam.org/trac/attachment/wiki/HarmonieWorkingWeek/Radiation201504/AOD_LW.png

    - Perhaps consider a LW comparison with DISORT as was done for the SW (GMDD paper by Nielsen, Gleeson, Rontu 2014)? Or is IFS RRTM sufficient for LW benchmark?
     
    - LW in hlradia with and without aerosol: can the Sodankylä comparisons be used as guidelines for improvements?

    
== Code development ==

=== Radiation cleaning within AROME physics ===

=== Radiation schemes in a common framework in the new physics-dynamics interface of cycle > cy40 ===


== Work space: notes, plans, comments ==

=== Aerosols issue - rounding errors sum(ZAER(:,:,1)) does not equal ZAELAN for example and so on.... Also in RADAER land=land+sulfates ===

=== Mail from LR re Acraneb2 === 
I think we need to check that ACRANEB2 really gets all those variables correctly also when called from  apl_arome, especially in MUSC. I'll try to have a look in March, after the EUMETCHEM workshop. This is also related to preparation of harmonie-40h1.radiation. We also need to know if our earlier 38-based MUSC experiments have been run correctly for the lalar option (things like those in ASW 2014 poster).

=== Link to Robin Hogan slides ===
http://slideplayer.com/slide/794020/
- It ends with a statement that IFS radiation resources should be shifted from high spectral resolution to more accurate description of clouds, in agreement with our focus.
