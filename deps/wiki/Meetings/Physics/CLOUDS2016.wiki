== Video meeting regarding microphysics updates for cycle 40h1.2, Karl-Ivar Ivarsson, Lisa Bengtsson, Sander Tijm - 20160819==

1) Freezing rain. Some more tests need to be done: Sander will send following code to Karl-Ivar (from Pleun's Master Thesis): [[BR]]

2.1: Rain accretion on a snow particle -> particle becomes a graupel particle[[BR]]
2.2: Heterogeneous cloud ice nucleation if T < 0C - Constant(dependent on vertical velocity)[[BR]]
2.3: Riming of snow if T<0C - Constant(dependent on vertical velocity)[[BR]]
2.4: Riming conversion of large size aggregates into graupel if T<0C - Constant(dependent on vertical velocity)[[BR]]
2.5: Rain accretion if T <0C - Constant(dependent on vertical velocity)[[BR]]
2.6: Raindrop accretion-conversion of the large size aggregates into graupel if T <0C - Constant(dependent on vertical velocity)[[BR]]
2.7: Dry growth of graupel if T <0C - Constant(dependent on vertical velocity)[[BR]]
6: Melting of graupel twice as slow[[BR]]

The main idea behind 2.2 - 2.7 is that ice does not develop in layers with temperatures below 0C if the air is not very turbulent. Initially, when the first clouds develop, ice nuclei will still be present and some ice crystals may form. After they are washed out (or have fallen out of the clouds), then the clouds will consist of water only and remain so if the ice nuclei are not replenished through vertical motion. Examples of this are fog for temperatures of 0 to -10 (we do not get much lower temperatures often enough in NL to know if the fog is still in liquid form at lower temperatures), the liquid clouds in which planes can punch holes, the freezing rain/drizzle conditions when temperatures are below 0C in the whole column.

Karl-Ivar suggests to not modify IN, instead proposed Thompson 2004: to put a limit for mixing-ratio for snow for when rain and snow  turning to graupel by accretion-conversion is set to 1.0E-5. Karl-Ivar will send this code to Sander and another meeting will be held Firday the 26th to conclude how to proceed. 

2) LGRSN flag is proposed to be set default TRUE (Lisa will communicate with Daniel and rest of HIRLAM MG). (Lisa will run a cold front case with too much graupel to see the impact).

3-4 below can be seen as bug-fixes and go in under OCND2. (Karl-Ivar will update trunk and send to Daniel. Lisa will communicate with Daniel and rest of HIRLAM MG).[[BR]]
3) Bug fixes for stratospheric warming[[BR]]
4) Accretion changes that were present in cycle 38, but fell out going to cycle 40, 43.[[BR]] 

5)Harmonization of ice crystal spectrum so it is the same in the sedimentation code as in rest of rain_ice.F90 - This does not yet give satisfactory result and we will hold off on this change.

6) CCN in radiation / microphysics not consistent. (Lisa will contact Yann and see if we can lift out the default values as namelist, then we should discuss why they are so different and what value would be appropriate with the radiation group).

7) Sander raised the question if the fields in HARMONIE-AROME are too smooth now with HARATU and OCND2, Sander will check with Meteo-France cases were convection has been missed by HARMONIE.[[BR]]
8) Sander raised the question if sensible heat from falling precipitation is taken into account in AROME. We concluded that this has been tested in the new physics-dynamics interface by Daan Degrauwe, but not sure which cycle release it will have an effect. Lisa can follow up. http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/2129/2016/gmd-9-2129-2016.pdf

== ------------------------------------------------ Summary and actions ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ==

* The work with the common MUSC continues. There are some challenges with phasing ICE4 updates from Meteo-France with HARATU and OCND2 updates. Expected to be resolved in May, 2016 and hopefully experimentation can start shortly after. [[BR]]
* Daan Degrauwe expressed some interest to compare also with ALARO-1 physics. Due to the extensive changes since cycle 38, this will probably be easier in cycle 43, and discussions have started with Claude Fischer, Eric Bazile, Lisa Bengtsson, Daniel Santos, Daan Degrauwe how to maintain the common MUSC system both in H and T environments. [[BR]]
* An action from the last meeting was to identify the test periods to run the common MUSC system for. They have been selected as:[[BR]]
-Lindenberg 1-31 May, 2013[[BR]]
-Kuopio 1-31 January, 2015[[BR]]
-Cabauw 1-31 August, 2011[[BR]]
-Chilbolton 1-31 July, 2012[[BR]]
* Eric Bazile is also working on trying various idealized campaigns, e.g. ASTEX, ARM, GABLS4... with the common MUSC.[[BR]]
* Sander Tijm has worked together with a Master student in trying to identify the reason why AROME/HARMONIE is too quick in generating ice/snow in situation where there should be freezing rain. It was expressed by others (Karl-Ivar Ivarsson, Christoph Wittman) to test their developments. (See presentation above). [[BR]]
* Laura Rontu expressed that passing in fraction of cloud that is ice, and fraction of cloud that is liquid, instead of total cloud cover as proposed by Karl-Ivar Ivarsson is not a good solution. An action is to continue this discussion. [[BR]]
* There was some discussion about the value and dependency of the inhomogeneity factor. The conclusion was that although there are quite some dependencies and an optimal value should probably be slightly smaller than 1, it is not worth debating whether it should be 1.0 or slightly smaller, but rather set it to 1.0 and focus on reducing cloud water/ice in the thickest clouds. [[BR]]
* ACTRIS (former cloudnet) observations reveal too little cloud-water and too much ice+snow+graupel compared with observations in HARMONIE cycle 40h1, it was pointed out by Kristian Pagh Nielsen that the ground based observations do not see the thickest clouds (as precipitating clouds are removed when rain present - the cloud extent is difficult to ascertain and liquid water path also uncertain). These thickest clouds are the ones that are assumed to over-predict the amount of cloud-water. An action is to continue with various methodologies to observe clouds: Clear Sky Index (CSI), ACTRIS, MSG/Polar satellite integrated cloud water... [[BR]]
* It was decided to have another (2½-3 day) working meeting on clouds in the fall, in collaboration with the radiation team. Time and place is to be determined. [[BR]]
