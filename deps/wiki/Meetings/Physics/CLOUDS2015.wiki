== ------------------------------------------------ Summary and actions ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ==

*) From ground-based observations we can see that cloud water is much better described using the new developments for mixed-phased clouds by Karl-Ivar (OCND2). You can see this for instance on page 8, 19 and 20 of Lisa's presentation and also in the presentation by Ewan O'Connor.

*) OCND2 has a very different partitioning between snow and ice compared with OCND2 = FALSE, these can not be distinguished in observations, but the sum of the two matched observations better than before. We are trying to understand what the implications are for radiation.

*) Karl-Ivar proposed an interesting solution in order to reduce graupel. This is something Sander said he would like to test more in large scale systems (frontal cases) with a student. We will also test it in "test-bed" experiments and experiments with cycle 40. In trunk this has been implemented under the switch LGRSN.

*) At Meteo-France they have put a lot of effort in trying to make the cloud-scheme time-step independent (e.g. before if you had a very small time-step, you got a lot more precipitation). In this process they found some bugs, and we need to understand the implications of these bug-corrections together with new microphysics developments (see Yann's presentation).

*) It was discussed that since we do not have a scheme that can correctly account for cloud condensation nuclei in the boundary layer, we think it is important to include a method such as the one proposed by Bent (Sundqvist auto-conversion) and/or Karl-Ivar (Kogan auto-conversion) in order to tackle the fog problem. When the LIMA scheme is in place, it will be interesting to understand if fog can drizzle out due to the in-homogeneous distribution of aerosol both in the vertical and land/sea. (These ideas have been tested in cycle 38 and 40, but are not part of trunk (as of 20160204).

*) It was confirmed by Meteo-France that they have the same problem with fog over sea as seen with HARMONIE runs. Fog/low clouds over land does not show the same systematic behavior.

*) Many different factors contribute to the "fog problem" - initialization, turbulence, microphysics, surface (fluxes), radiation (e.g. inhom. factor). So no "single" solution can be found. However, both HARATU and microphysics changes proposed by Wim and Bent and Karl-Ivar work in the right direction.

*) SAL verification of clouds over Spain show that cloud are well reproduced when significant synoptic forcing (fronts, low pressures systems...), but overstimated fog over land, and understimate low clouds and fog in the South Mediterranean. HARMONIE-AROME seem to forecast low level clouds over Cantabric sea better than AROME-MF and ARPEGE where low level clouds seem to be underestimated. Why?

New developments include:
HARATU (Wims slides)
New Graupel (K-I's slides)
"Warm-rain" (Bents slides)
"LLCRIT" (Lisa's slides)
EDKF - with new closure (Eric's slides)

These will be evaluated against "cloudnet stations" (Cabauw, Lindenberg, Chilbolton, Juelich, Sodankyla,...) in a test-bed based on MUSC in order to understand the impact on boundary layer processes. We will include the new ICE3 modifications as a default. It was discussed that some other radiation settings also should be updated as default.

* (2016-02-04): Wim has sent test-bed code to Lisa, Lisa will collect all the above mentioned developments and phase them into the test-bed set up based on cy38h1.2. 

* Test-periods and stations need to be identified (depending on where there is data)

* Can we do month-long simulations with MUSC? Avoid drifts?

* 3D experiments on fog cases will be carried out but it was decided to not try to coordinate these in the same way as the 1D experiments since there are so many external factors (lateral boundaries, domain area and size... etc) that influences the result.

Lisa and Bent (others) will identify 5 fog cases over Denmark, Spain, France, Holland and Sweden. And run these cases with HARATU (trunk), Warm-rain autoconv and Kogan autoconv to understand impact.
