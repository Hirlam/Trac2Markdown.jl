= Introduction =

This page describes how to merge a T(oulouse) Cycle of the HARMONIE source code into our git repository.

[ The git commands described herein were provided by Kai Sattler]

= Establish the phasing repo =

== Create a local repo from your Harmonie fork on hirlam.org ==
{{{
git clone git@hirlam.org:users/<your username>/Harmonie $HOME/repo/users/<your username>/Harmonie
cd $HOME/repo/users/<your username>/Harmonie
}}}

== Create remotes to the central public Harmonie repo and to the MF arpifs repo ==
{{{
git remote add public git@hirlam.org:Harmonie
git remote add arpifs ssh://reader054@mfgit/git/arpifs.git
}}}
For the latter remote designation to work, you will have to add the following to your ~/.ssh/config:
{{{
Host mfgit
  Hostname git.cnrm-game-meteo.fr
  User <your registered name at mfgit>
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<your registered ssh-key>
}}}

= Establish the branches for the merge procedure =

== Assure your develop branch is up-top-date ==
{{{
git checkout develop
git pull public develop
git push origin develop
}}}

== Branch-off the new cycle branch ==
{{{
git checkout -b pre-CYnm
}}}

== Get relevant MF branches ==
{{{
git fetch arpifs master:mf-master
git checkout mf-master
git fetch arpifs CYnmT1.0x:mf-CYnmT1.0x
git checkout mf-CYnmT1.0x
}}}

= Prepare for the branch comparison =

== Create a repo copy for easier comparison of branches ==
{{{
rsync --delete -avHc $HOME/repo/users/<your username>/Harmonie $HOME/repo/users/<your username>/Harmonie.wrk
}}}
== Move to the new cycle branch ==
{{{
git checkout pre-CYnm
}}}
== Possibility to see diffs between branches pre-CYnm and mf-CYnmT1.0x by comparing ==
{{{
$HOME/repo/users/<your username>/Harmonie, which represents pre-CYnm
$HOME/repo/users/<your username>/Harmonie.wrk, which represents mf-CYnmT1.0x
}}}
and asking for assistance


= Start the merge =

== Find the latest common ancestors ==
{{{
git merge-base pre-CYnm mf-master
git merge-base pre-CYnm mf-CYnmT1.0x
}}}
== Perform merge within in git ==
{{{
git checkout pre-CYnm
git merge mf-CYnmT1.0x
}}}
All simple auto-merges are directly added to the index (staging area for commit), the conflicing files remain in the working area.

Perform conflict resolution on the "obvious" conflicts (i.e., those that do not necessitate subject knowledge), and add the resolved files to the index
{{{
git add <resolved file>
}}}
== Postpone all other conflicts ==
{{{
git -?
}}}

= While there are non-obvious conflicts =

== Try to resolve them with expert help, then add to the index ==
{{{
git add <resolved file>
}}}
== Occasionally merge develop into the pre-CYnm branch ==

THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE RIGHT AWAY, because the unfinished branch pre-CYnm blocks your phasing repo for other work, especially due to the pending conflicts.

If you absolutely want/need to do this, then  create two preliminary commits:

=== Re-commit the resolved files ===
{{{
git commit -s -m "pre-commit merge mf-CYnmT1.0x resolved"
}}}
=== "Resolve" somehow all conflicts in a preliminary way, and pre-commit them ===
{{{
git add .
git commit -s -m "pre-commit merge mf-CYnmT1.0x resolved"
}}}
BUT NOTE: you might run into new conflicts when trying to merge newer updates from develop branch!

= If no conflicts remain, perform a final merge of develop into pre-CYnm =
{{{
git commit -s
}}}

= Perform a merge of pre-CYnm into develop and declare the merge of CYnmT1.0x complete =

== Merge into your local develop ==
{{{
git checkout develop
git merge pre-CYnm
}}}
== Tag the merge ==
{{{
git tag -a -m "merge mf-CYnmT1.0x" CYnmh1
}}}
== Publish the merge with the tag into the public develop ==
{{{
git push --tags public develop
}}}
