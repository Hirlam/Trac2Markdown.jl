# HARMONIE-38h1 parameter list and GRIB1 definitions



## HARMONIE system output

The HARMONIE system writes its primary output to the upper air history files, ICMSHHARM+llll, and the SURFEX history file ICMSHHARM+llll.fa, in FA format, where llll is the current timestep in hours. The files are designed to be complete snapshots of respective model state described by the system for a particular time point. In addition more model output including post-processing/diagnostic fields can be written out during the forecast model integration, such as those model diagnostics or pressure level diagnostics in FA format as FPHARMDOMAIN+llll. The FA and files can be considered to be internal format file. All of them are converted to GRIB1 files during the run for external usage. The name convention is as follows:

History files: ICMSHHARM+llll -> fcyyyymmdd_hh+lll_grib
Surfex files: ICMSHHARM+llll.fa -> fcyyyymmdd_hh+lll_grib_sfx
Postprocessed files: FPHARMDOMAIN+llllXX -> fcyyyymmmdd_hh+lll_grib_fp

## New GRIB1 table 2 version in HARMONIE

To avoid conflicts with archived HIRLAM data HARMONIE uses version 253 of table 2. The table is based on the standard WMO version 3 of table 2 and postion 000-127 is kept the same as in the WMO. Note that accumulated and instantaneous versions of the same parameter differ only by the [time range indicator](http://www.ecmwf.int/publications/manuals/libraries/gribex/wmoCodeTable5.html). It is thus not sufficient to specify parameter, type and level when you refer to an accumulated parameter, but the time range indicator has to be included as well.

**The translation of SURFEX files to GRIB1 is still incomplete and contains several WMO violations. This is not changed in the current release but will revised later.** However, the upper air history file also includes the most common surface parameters and should be sufficient for most users. For the description of SURFEX variables check [here](./Forecast/Outputlist/38h1/SURFEX.md).

The current table 2 version 253 definition files for grib_api can be found here: [GRIB-API local definitions](https://hirlam.org/trac/browser/branches/gl_grib_api/definitions/). These local definition files assume centre=233 (Dublin) and should be copied to your own GRIB-API installation. You are strongly recommended to set your own code for generating centre fore operational usage of the data.

**The version for 37h1.1 is available [here]**[[BR]](./Forecast/Outputlist/37h1.1.md)
**The version for 37h1.2 is available [here](./Forecast/Outputlist/37h1.md)**


### Changes between cy37h1.2 and cy38h1.1

In the following tables differences with the last main HARMONIE release 37h1.2 have been indicated as listed below.

 * ***[[Color(red, Changed variables in red-bold-italic.)]]*** GRIB1 code, unit or content has been changed.

 * [[Color(red, New variables in red.)]] New variable included in the default output or new variable available as postprocessing option

 * ~~Removed variables in strike-through.~~ GRIB1 code removed from this version.

 * [[Color(green, Optional variables in the present version in green.)]] Available through namelist specification, not included in the default output.

## GRIB encoding information

### Time units, WMO code table 4

The following time units are used to encode GRIB edition 1 data


| Code | Unit | 
| --- | --- |
|0 | Minute |
|1 | Hour |
|13 | 15 minutes |
|14 | 30 minutes |

### Time range indicator, WMO code TABLE 5


| Code | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0    | Forecast product valid for reference time + P1 (P1 > 0), or Uninitialized analysis product for reference time (P1 = 0) | 
| 2    | 	Product with a valid time ranging between reference time + P1 and reference time + P2. Used for min/max values |
| 4    | Accumulation (reference time + P1 to reference time + P2) product considered valid at reference time + P2 | 

Note that fields available as both instanteous and accumulated values like e.g. rain has the same parameter values and can only be distinguished by the time range indicator.

### Harmonie GRIB1 code table 2 version 253 - Indicator of parameter
Below the indicator of parameter code table for the Harmonie model. It is based on the WMO code table 2 version 3 with local parameters added. Parameter indicators 128-254 are reserved for originating center use. Parameter indicators 000-127 should not be altered. In HARMONIE, radiation fluxes are assumed positive downwards (against the recommendation by WMO).
