
## Platform Configuration
## Overview
This wiki page outlines the configuration files required by HARMONIE for successful compilation and running of the system.

## Basic requirements
All experiments require a valid host to "setup" an experiment using the Harmonie script. Recall from the [quick start](HarmonieSystemDocumentation/QuickStartLocal) instructions that in order to setup a new experiment on your platform, called YOURHOST, using HARMONIE downloaded to PATH_TO_HARMONIE one must issue the following command:
```bash
cd hm_home/my_exp
PATH_TO_HARMONIE/config-sh/Harmonie setup -r PATH_TO_HARMONIE -h YOURHOST
```
hm_home/my_exp contains:
```bash
Env_submit -> config-sh/submit.YOURHOST           ## YOURHOST platform specific settings
Env_system -> config-sh/config.YOURHOST           ## YOURHOST task submission settings
./config-sh/hm_rev                                ## contains PATH_TO_HARMONIE
./config-sh/Main                                  ## The script used to run HARMONIE
./config-sh/submit.YOURHOST                       ## YOURHOST platform specific settings
./config-sh/config.YOURHOST                       ## YOURHOST task submission settings
./suites/harmonie.pm                              ## perl module to define ensemble settings
./ecf/config_exp.h                                ## your experiment definition (scientific type options)
./scr/include.ass                                 ## assimilation specific settings
```
But, what if your host configuration is not available in the HARMONIE system? Host specific configuration files in PATH_TO_HARMONIE/config-sh must be available for your host and configuration files for the compilation of the code must be available. This documentation attempts to describe what is required.
## Host config files
### Env_system -> config-sh/config.YOURHOST
The config.YOURHOST file defines host specific variables such as some input directory locations. If your YOURHOST is not already included in HARMONIE it may be work looking at config.* files in [config-sh](Harmonie/config-sh?rev=release-43h2.beta.3) to see what other people have done. The table below outlines variables set in config-sh/config-sh.YOURHOST and what the variables do:
|# Variable name|# Description|

### Env_submit -> config-sh/submit.YOURHOST
The Env_submit file uses perl to tell the HARMONIE scheduler how to execute programs - which programs should be run on multiple processors and define batch submissions if required.
|# perl|= description                                                                                                                       |
