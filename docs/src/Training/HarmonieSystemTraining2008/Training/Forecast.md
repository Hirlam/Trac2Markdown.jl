## Practice tasks


### Climate

 * Run with and without SPSMORO


### Nesting

 * Try different boundary strategies with RCR data on HPCE
 * Create NH fields with gl
 * Create boundary files for AROME without any cloud variables and run a forecast
 * Run ALARO without any TKE input
 * Play with the intermediate domain (BDCLIM)
    * Create a domain with the same resolution as the HOST model
    * Create a domain withe the same resolution as the TARGET model
