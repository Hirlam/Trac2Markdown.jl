# Common HIRLAM & Harmonie Monitoring


## HIRLAM monitoring portal

Hirlam-A is tasked to coordinate an consortia-wide effort to provide an timely and efficient monitoring facility to measure the development of the HIRLAM forecast system in a **measurable way**. A product data portal at hirlam.org is one of the convenient means to realise such a goal.

We aim to develop and extend the [hirlam.org monitoring portal](../../../oprint/general.md) for real-time joint monitoring and inter-comparison. And if feasible, to extend it for HARMONIE system as well.

### Real-time operational HIRLAM model monitoring and inter-comparison
Detailed routine monitoring of operational NWP suites is the task of the operational services. With hirlam.org monitoring portal, we aim to develop common monitoring to cover aspects that are suitable for joint monitoring. This may also include links to various monitoring webpages to show various monitoring tools/features for inspiration.
  * [Observation verification](https://www.hirlam.org/portal/oprint/ObsVer)
    * The procedure to extract model data for observation verification is explained in the [Hirlam system documentation page](../../../HirlamSystemDocumentation/PostPP/CommonVerification.md)
  * [Monitoring of Data assimilation and use of observation](https://www.hirlam.org/portal/monitor)
  * [Statistical Diagnosis of operational runs ](https://www.hirlam.org/portal/oprint/ObsVer/Logplot)

### Near future plan

  * extend mast profile verification
  * meteogram
  * forecast chart
  * extend vfld for Tmin, Tmax, visibility, gustwind 
  * look at introduction of SAL/radar simulator, comparison to NWP SAF cloudness, surface radiation measurement...

### Further contribution from HIRLAM staffs and services to the data portal
  * many monitoring features can be introduced. The project needs participation by more staffs with different background
  * operational service: delivering of real-time data
    * vfld data (KNMI, AEMET still missing)
    * measurement data suitable for joint monitoring 
    * real time delivery of GRIB data with limited collection of parameters?

## HARMONIE monitoring portal
  * Possibility for a joint data portal for real-time monitoring, as an extension to the current one for HIRLAM?
