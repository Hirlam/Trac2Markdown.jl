## Programme

 The training course will cover topics like

 * Monday: Dynamics, System introduction, experimentation
 * Tuesday: AROME/ALARO physics, SURFEX, Climate aspects
 * Wednesday: Climate aspects, Diagnostics and verification
 * Thursday: Current scientific problems ( presented by the participants )

 During the week lectures will be mixed with practical hands on exercises.

### Online and recorded lectures

Remote participation will be provided using the EUMETCAL Centra !OnDemand system. Recorded lectures from 2014 can be found [here](../HarmonieSystemTraining2014/Eumetcal.md). 

## Preparations

 * Please remember to bring your own laptop and make sure that you can connect to a wireless network. For the exercises we will mainly use the ECMWF HPC facilities so make sure that you have a user account at ECMWF and belong to the hirald group. **For those coming from countries/institutes that does not provide ECMWF access we will arrange with temporary accounts on the SMHI research cluster bi. Please let us know ASAP if you need such account.**

 * The course will be based on two recent versions of HARMONIE. 
   * The special climate branch [HCLIM-38h1.1](../HarmonieClimate.md) developed by the Rossby Centre at SMHI
   * The next NWP version [harmonie-40h1.1.beta.3](../Harmonie_40h1.md) targeted for operational use during the autumn. This version includes some of the development from the HCLIM branch.
You can prepare yourself by browsing through the [documentation](../HarmonieSystemDocumentation.md) and the information about the [climate version](../HarmonieClimate.md). If you intend to install HARMONIE locally ( on your laptop or your institutes HPC ) make sure it has all the needed [components](../HarmonieSystemDocumentation/General.md).

 * The Thursday morning will be devoted to students feedback. We kindly ask everyone to prepare a 5-15 minute presentation about your climate related research, scientific challenges and possible future use of HARMONIE climate. Feel free to give a shared presentation if you are several people coming from the same institute. Please let us know if you will give a presentation or not before the 10th of September.

 * The workshop dinner will be held on Monday evening. Please let us know if you have special requirements for the food. We kindly ask the lecturers to inform us who will attend the the dinner.
